            <p>T H U R S D AY,  N O V E M B E R  0 9 ,  2 0 0 6"Gilmore Girls" On The Brink......of losing me. I watched Tuesday night's episode and was aghast. Butfirst, that recent NYT diatribe on the show. They're right that the showsucks now, but they get it all wrong. Virginia Heffernan says,"That was the charm of the old show: women, fundamentallywomen without men, were compelled to talk as fast as theycould to keep their loneliness at bay."And this,"Lorelai’s internal life — her desperate loneliness (come on,have any of these forgettable guys even come close to matchingher?) coupled with her untenable reliance on her daughter asthe one true thing in her existence — is clear to longtimeviewers."Huh? The witty, sparkling, screwball comedy-worthy banter from theshow's glory years was merely a front to keep loneliness at bay? Whatwere Rosalind Russell and Katharine Hepburn? Manic depressives?Lorelai was desperately lonely and had a freakish dependence on herdaughter? I don't know what show Heffernan was watching, but itwasn't "Gilmore Girls." I didn't see a woman who was desperatelylonely because she didn't have a man. I saw a smart, intelligent, funnywoman who had raised a terrific kid as a single mom and excelled inbusiness. She was open to the possibility of romance but she wasn'tsitting around waiting for a knight in shining armor.And who says she was lonely? Both Lorelai and Rory were part of awarm, vibrant community -- surrounded by friends and coworkers andindeed an entire town that loved and respected them. Lorelai hadissues with her mother and the show (initially, at least) slowly drewthem back together. And her relationship with her daughter wasn'tco-dependant; it was delightful. If you described a man who wassupremely witty and fun and sexy, who raised a kid on his own (and agreat kid, at that) and was running a successful business and poised tolaunch a business of his own, he would be described in one word: acatch.Typically, the NYT probably got it wrong -- the way they did withNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
