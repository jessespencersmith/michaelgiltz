8/15/2005 07:20:00 PMA NYT column in the magazine about Europe's growing andincreasingly unhappy Muslim population. Hey, if you don't wantto live in a free society that respects the rights of women andinfidels and other religions, why did you move to the UK/France/Holland/etc in the first place?But of course, the most restive members of these communitiesDIDN'T move there. They were born there. Hence mycomplaint about this sentence:But Europeans can hardly accept an immigrant vetoover their own mores, whether those mores involvewomen's rights or, for that matter, the right to blaspheme,which the Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh so bravelyasserted -- and died for.What "immigrant veto?" That paints European Muslims as outsiderswhen, for better or worse, they're part of these communities -- ifpoorly assimilated. I was born in Bermuda of an American father andCanadian mother, raised in Florida and didn't get US citizenship till Iwas older and wanted to vote. That makes me more of an"immigrant" than the London bombers, most of whom were born andraised in the UK.Still, what do you do if a people want to live in your society but don'tembrace the values that society stands for?
