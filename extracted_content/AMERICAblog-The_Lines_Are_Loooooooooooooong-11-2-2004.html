11/02/2004 01:14:00 PMAs you can see from the comments of all our visitors, the news on TVand anecdotal stories from all over the country (and not just theswing states like Florida), the lines are looooong today. It's abeautiful thing but if you swung by the polls and decided you'd waittill after work, you're going to be in even longer lines tonight. Go onyour lunch break and tell your boss you WON'T COME BACK untilyou've voted. Take off an hour early from work to get a head start onthe evening crush. Bring a snack and something to read. Call in sick.Take a sick day with their permission. Do whatever you must. Butvote. It really matters.Our fearless leader John in DC says the lines are long there andmaybe some years he could understand why people wouldn't bother-- DC will clearly be going for Kerry. But no matter what state you'rein, the popular vote is crucial. The larger the popular vote for Kerry,the more difficult it will be for Bush to challenge a few key states andswing the election. Kerry won't make the mistakes Gore made fouryears ago, but Bush won't have a ghost of a chance if it's 53% Kerryand 47% Bush. The popular vote matters. If you're in Texas orCalifornia or New York or wherever, you MUST vote. Regardless of theElectoral College, it could mean the difference between victory orweeks of court challenges. It will also mean the difference between arazor thin win and a popular mandate for change and a resoundingkick in the ass for Bush as he heads out the back door.
