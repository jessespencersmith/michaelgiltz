9/12/2005 01:11:00 AMPariah-like adviser Dick Morris says Bush will recover from thistravesty and Morris may have a point.People can stay angry only for so long and once themuch-delayed and bungled relief effort finally starts to gaintraction, the MSM and certainly Bush will want to focus on thegood stuff happening now rather than "tiresomely" bringing upthe scandal of those first five days. Is he right? As the deathtoll rises and images of the dead bodies float to the surface,I'm not so sure. But never discount the cynical wisdom ofsomeone like Morris.
