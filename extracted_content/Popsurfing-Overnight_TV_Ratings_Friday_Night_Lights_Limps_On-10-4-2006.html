            <p>W E D N E S D AY,  O C TO B E R  0 4 ,  2 0 0 6Overnight TV Ratings -- "Friday Night Lights"Limps OnIn what has to be the stupidest programming move of the year, NBCdebuted its critically acclaimed "Friday Night Lights" opposite GameOne of the post-season baseball matchup between the New YorkYankees and Detroit. Gee, think maybe sports fans might be caught upin the race for the World Series? If ever a show should have been heldfor mid-season, when it could have premiered in January amidst thehype of the Super Bowl but without tons of sports competition, "FridayNight Lights" was it. Having watched the pilot, I'm especially upsetbecause it's so good. This could be a great series but NBC may haveblown it. Watch the rerun of the pilot on NBC tonight if you can. Thebook was great, the feature film (I thought) was exceptional and thisseries could have dug deeper. And how nice to see people praying onTV who aren't polygamists or hypocrites. (And if the show is reallyaccurate, we'd soon see the Coach with his family at Sunday service.)Now I think NBC should take "Friday Night Lights" and "Studio 60 onthe Sunset Strip" and put them on Saturday and LEAVE THEMTHERE. They are too good to throw away and Saturday night is toomuch real estate (ie air time) to ignore. I haven't seen "30 Rock" butone more very good pilot airs tonight on ABC at 10 p.m.: "The Nine." Itand "Friday Night Lights" are my two favorite new shows. Here are theratings per MediaWeek's Marc Berman:8 p.m.1. Dancing With The Stars (ABC -- 90 minute) -- 18.28 million2. NCIS (CBS) -- 15.52 million3. Friday Night Lights (NBC) -- 7.18 million4. Yankees Vs Detroit (FOX) -- 7.88 million for the night (ratingsincrease during evening so FNL ranks higher in the 8 p.m. hour)5. Gilmore Girls (CW) -- 4.71 million9 p.m.1. Dancing With The Stars (ABC -- last half hour) -- 20.09 million2. The Unit (CBS) -- 13.17 million3. Law & Order: Criminal Intent (NBC) -- 12.04 million4. Help Me Help You (ABC 9:30) -- 10.4 million5. Veronica Mars (CW) -- 3.27 millionNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
