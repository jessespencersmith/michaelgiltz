lf you think recording an album of children's music is all
lsw-e-etness and light and fun and games, think again.
I Kids music superstar Laurie Berkner,s latest CD _
- "Rocketship" is her fifth CD - and the first in six years
for Berkner, a mainstay on the Noggin children's channel,
especiallythe series "Jack,s Big Muiic Show," onwhich shehas already performed some of the tunes from the album.
Adding to her stress, in a good way, was the fact Berkner
was now a mother, which meant she was working a lot less
with children while trying to write music kids woirld enloy.
"It's been a long time, and I have less daily interaction -
with lots of kids," explains Berkner. .,I have much more
daily interaction with one kid. It,s funny - I worked with
so many more adults and so many fewer kids. I actually
found that somewhat stressful.
"When I'm working with the kids, it's like, .Oh. vou like
this? Great. This one will be fun.'you can feel it working.
I felt like I was depending on myself and the reactions oT
adults. I'm glad adults like [the CD]. But if kids don't like it,
no adult is going to buy it.,', Berkne4, 39, began her music careerwith choirs. then
r segued into playing music at day-care centers and pre_
; schools.
r She performed in a rockband called l,ois Lane. but it
: wasn't until she started writing songs for children that the
, funes reallybeganto flow.
i Now, kids are teaching her an important lesson: Share
; your toys. For the first time, Berkner has recorded origi_
: na1 solgs written byherband members (Susie Lampert andI Adam Bernstein), as well as having a lot more input from
; herproducer.
, 'Yeah, I stopped being a control freak," laughs Berkner.' "I've been working on that
and take it seriously, That feels good to me - to really take
seriously what I'm doing so thaf otherpeople feel that. And
then have as much fun as I can with it.;

time to spend with kids while creating.Rocketship."</p>
