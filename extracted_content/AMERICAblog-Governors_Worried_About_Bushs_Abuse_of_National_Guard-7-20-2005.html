7/20/2005 01:32:00 AMThe annual National Governors Association met in Des Moinesand one big issue on their plate? Bush's abuse of the NationalGuard. We're only beginning to understand how Bush'sbackdoor draft and abuse of the Guard is damaging ournational security here at home and our ability to respond tonatural disasters.The nation's governors are expressing growing concern thatthe extended deployment of National Guard soldiers in Iraqis depleting troop resources at home, threatening toleave states unable to respond to the naturaldisasters, civil unrest and other domesticemergencies that traditionally lead governors to call outthe Guard.The state's leaders, meeting here at the summer gatheringof the National Governors Association, said they wereworried that the extended overseas deployments,combined with declining enlistments as National Guardstints have become lengthy postings in war zones, wouldstrip them of what has for years been a bulwarkagainst domestic emergencies.THis is going to be a problem for many, many years to come. Thanks,Bush!
