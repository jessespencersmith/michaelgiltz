UI ding Success at the Art House. 
Among independent movie companies just now, no one-not even Miramax-is having a better run than Sony 
Pictures Classics. It has distributed the Oscar winner for Best Foreign Film three years in a row, and is behind 
Farinelli, Amateur, the high·grossing 3·D Imax movie Wings of Courage, and the well· received Crumb. Even 
SPC's labor-of-Iove retrospective of films by Indian director Satyajit Ray is turning into a surprising commercial suc· 
cess. To top it off, just last week, Michael Barker, Tom Bernard, and Marcie Bloom-the troika that runs SPC-arrived 
at the Cannes Film Festival, where their Christmas 
movie The City of Lost Children was chosen for the 
opening-night slot. The team's sudden ascension can 
be credited, its members say, to their ability to 
change. "We've broadened our horizons," says 
Michael Barker, referring to the edgier, Miramaxier 
pictures SPC has been acquiring lately. And it's clear 
the last year has marked a dramatic shift for a com· 
pany traditionally known for specializing in stereo­
typically old·school foreign films like Genninal and 
Howards End. They've also imitated Miramax's 
studiolike aggressiveness by acquiring properties earlier and earlier. "Forty percent of our slate is acquired at the 
script stage," Barker says. "A few years ago, that wasn't the case." But they also credit the ways in which they haven't 
changed. SPC sticks to releasing around fourteen films a year and quieUy strives to make each one profitable. Still, 
it's a whole new world out there, and the folks at SPC have taken note of it. "We have hordes of people going to see 
Ray, Crumb, and Wings of Courage, and the audiences are all different," says Barker. "It's not the same as it used to 
be fifteen years ago, where you had your classic art film, and that was it." MICHAEl GILTZ</p>
