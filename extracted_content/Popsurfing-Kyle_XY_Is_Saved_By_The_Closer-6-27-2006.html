            <p>T U E S D AY,  J U N E  2 7 ,  2 0 0 6"Kyle XY" Is "Saved" By "The Closer"Three new shows airing on Monday nights. I can see why KyraSedgwick's "The Closer" is a hit -- it's a relatively straighforward copshow, with Sedgwick drawling out her Southern niceties while tearingthrough a crime scene like a bloodhound on a trail. But comparing herto Jane Tennison of "Prime Suspect" is a huge leap, even if Sedgwickdoes have a shabby personal life. But don't people ever wait for theirlawyers? Sedgwick ends every episode by cornering a suspect ininterrogation and pulling out the info she needs with the ease of PerryMason cracking a witness on the stand. I thought that sort of manueverwent the way of Dudley Do-Right. It's hard to imagine it working wheneven punk gang members know enough to ask for their "Johnny" (ieJohnny Cochrane ie their lawyer) the second they're arrested.I kind of like Tom Everett Scott (of "That Thing You Do!") in "Saved"and David Clennon (Miles from "thirtysomething") has some very goodmoments as his surgeon father. But this meandering look at EMTworkers is toothless and confusing. When they touch a patient on thescene, we get a black and white flashback quickly showing us thebackstory of the victim. (For a minute, I thought our hero was psychic.)But the accidents are way too "crazy," from a guy falling "out of the sky"onto a woman's car to a crazed dad upset his son is gay going into a gaybar with a hatchet. Throw in Scott's ex-girlfriend and a swishy gay loanshark he owes a gambling debt to (!) and you've got a lot more going onthan it's worth keeping track of.And "Kyle XY" is a pseudo sci-fi mush of everything from "Powder" to"Starman" and a million other sci-fi TV shows, movies and books allwhipped together. Our good looking alien (how come aliens made toappear human are never ugly or at least average looking?) just pops upin the middle of the woods and is soon ensconced at the suburbanhome of a social worker/psychiatrist and her dull, anonymous family.Kyle "observes" the family with endless voice-overs that range fromdull to treacly -- though I did like the scene where he feels a pain in hisstomach (everything is new to Kyle) and then suddenly feels very, verygood and we realize he's peed in his pants. You don't see that every day.But the cast -- Kyle aside -- is too weak to rise above the genericmaterial.Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
