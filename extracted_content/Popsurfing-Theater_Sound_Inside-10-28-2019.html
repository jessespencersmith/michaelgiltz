THEATER: "The Sound Inside" Gets Muffled By
Finale
THE  SOUND  INSIDE  *** out of ****
STUDIO  54  
Pulitzer finalist Adam Rapp molds his new play out of very familiar
clay.
Bella is a lonely academic and writer at Yale just told she has terminal
cancer. One novel, many years ago, received acclaim (though not from
the New York Times) and Bella has trudged along ever since. Single,quietly sad, artistically dead and now a future of chemotherapyfollowed by death? What's the point?
Christopher is a lonely student. Wildly opinionated like only college
students can be, Christopher has no friends, despises the internet,loves Bella's lone novel, hates to be touched and is working on a bookof his own in a frenzy of youthful passion.
You can fill in the rest. However, even the most familiar of stories
becomes fresh when told with flair. As it unfolds, those well-worncliches come to life again and you think, yes, ok, I'm going with it.Then, heartbreakingly, it stumbles in the home stretch, enough tomake you rethink some of your earlier appreciation. The fault lies with
Rapp. This is an impeccable, beautifully acted production of a flawed
work.
A two-hander, it begins on a mostly bare stage with Bella wandering
outdoors, pen and paper in hand, working out some ideas for a story.
Showing artists at work is always hard. At least painters can slap on
some paint or musicians can bring a new song to life. Writers can onlyscribble away. But Rapp manages the feat nicely, with Bella pausing toreword some idea, add a flourish or scratch one out as the momentdemands.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

BOOKS: Don't Bother Trying To</p>
<p>It helps that Bella is played by Mary-Louise Parker, easily one of the
best actors working today and a very good writer herself. (Her literary
memoir  Dear  Mr.  You  is a delight and I trust she's working on a new
novel or stories or something  else of her own.) Parker exudes
intelligence and her Bella is wry, self-aware and utterly convincing on
every level.
As Bella shares her story, sets materialize out of the darkness, such as
a professor's crammed office, a living room, a park and so on. Everytechnical element shines here: the scenic design of AlexanderWoodward, the lighting of Heather Gilbert, the spot-on costumes of
David Hyman and the deft music and sound of Daniel Kluger (hot off
his marvelous new arrangements and orchestrations for Oklahoma! ).
Overseen by the invisible hand of director David Cromer, the effect ispositively magical, with sets floating into vision just when needed andquietly slipping away when their work is done. Without any flash, it
feels just like memory or a writer's imagination at work. Everyone is in
top form.
So The  Sound  Inside  begins as a person-facing-cancer story until the
insecure Christopher shoves his way in. He detours the story into
several tantalizing possibilities: a romance beginning just as life is
ending, a teacher/student tutorial on life and the craft of writing as
Bella's final act, the tortured writer run out of things to say faced witha dazzling protégé handing over the sole copy of his first (brilliant)novel?
Actor Will Hochman plays Christopher, a role Jesse Eisenberg would
have gobbled up fifteen years ago. You might say he goes toe to toewith Parker and holds his own, but that misses the teamwork ondisplay. They are wonderfully in sync throughout. Hochman matches
Parker but this isn't remotely a contest; their camaraderie at the
curtain call says all you need to know. It's an impressive Broadwaydebut. And for, oh, 80% of the night, it's a very impressive play."Find Me"

<p>SPOILER ALERTS
It's impossible to discuss the flaws of the play without ruining the plot
and the finale. If you have a chance to see the show in New York City,by all means take the time. You'll see Parker in top form and a strongnew talent in Hochman. Afterwards you can debate with your friends
(or me) about the last "act" of this brisk, entertaining 90 minute
evening of drama.
Ok, here we go. Seriously, I'm going to describe every twist of the play
right to the end. At one point as Bella and Christopher become friends,
colleagues in writing (of a sort) and perhaps more, she invites him outto dinner and then back to her place for a drink and more discussion.Christopher mentions a girl in high school (it didn't work out) and a
young woman in college who dumps him for a member of the glee
club. "You've been Whiffenpoofed," Bella deadpans. Christopherteeters on the edge of self-absorbed and annoying, but Hochman reinsthis in with a performance that allows us to empathize with the humanemotions roiling underneath Christopher's would-be misanthropy.
He's not an incel (that is, a guy who is misogynistic and self-loathing
to a dangerous degree) and heck, he might even be a little asexual.Christopher blurts out at one point that he's about as sexual as youraverage parking meter. But then he cautiously reaches out and brushesBella's cheek. She quietly leaves the room, brings back a pillow and
sheets so he can crash on her couch and then goes to bed. It's not a
rejection so much as an end to the evening. Yet, it's a while before theyreconnect.
When Christopher finally comes back to have another dinner with
Bella, he brings the only copy of his novella, typed on a manual
typewriter and thus the sole copy in the world, as he makes clear. He's
eager for Bella's opinion. Instead, she tells Christopher about theterminal cancer, her refusal to punish herself with pointlesschemotherapy and asks him to help her commit suicide. She's bought
everything needed from the internet but needs Christopher to be her
"injection buddy," the essential partner to make it all go smoothly. Oh,and she wants to do it that very night.
Christopher agrees, but insists she read his work first and give a
complete and frank assessment. She does and it's a masterpiece. In
plays like this, college students always  produce masterpieces. Then
Bella is injected with the first needle putting her to sleep...and wakesup fifteen or so hours later. Christopher is gone and later discovereddead, facedown in the snow. Bellas' cancer miraculously goes into
remission and she's left with his novella, a work she quietly noted
earlier has no copyright, no indication that anyone else on the planeteven knows it exists. (He had no friends whatsoever and even stoppedgoing to his classes.)

<p>Christopher's body, still working out in her mind how to describe the
scene. "Did this park imagine his body?" she asks herself/the
audience. "Would that be a better image?"
And so it ends. Why in heaven's name have I detailed every single plot
point right up to the finale? Every possible complaint about  The  Sound
Inside  involves the final scenes, the moments that make you say,
"Wait, what?"
Early on, Christopher insists the only way to become famous today is
to commit suicide or be on Twitter. He then dives into a list of famous
literary suicides. Never mind the endless list one can make of great
writers who didn't commit suicide, it's just the sort of thing excitablecollege students like to proclaim as fact. But does that mean aftercreating his undeniable masterpiece Christopher chooses to seal hisfame by offing himself? If so, Hochman's nicely modulated
performance doesn't work. We don't think for a second that this
character he plays is about to kill himself.
Maybe Christopher is lovelorn? Not really. Like Chekhov's gun, the
moment where Christopher brushes Bella's cheek is the gun that nevergoes off. They're both lonely and a romance or at least a physicalrelationship is clearly a possibility. But Rapp doesn't have Bella reject
Christopher in any definitive way. It's just an unexplored, unsatisfying
option. And why did Bella invite Christopher to sleep on her couch?Couldn't he have just walked back to his place or Uber'd if it wasfarther? It's just another confusing signal for him and us.
If he's not aiming for fame or distraught over not becoming her lover,
was his death just an accident? That would be deflating anduninteresting. On the night when Bella asks Christopher for help inkilling herself ("Will I get extra credit?" I wanted him to ask), surely
he could have said, "First, read my novella and then sleep with me. I
can kill you tomorrow." And whatever happens as a result of thatwould surely be more consequential and rooted in who they are thenthe unresolved suggestions we're given.
The show annoyingly and rather obliquely suggests Bella might publish
Christopher's work as her own. Again, either take that Deathtrap  of a
plot twist or don't. Being coy helps no one. And does her critique of hiswork have to be that it's an unalloyed masterpiece? Surely, she'd havesomething constructively helpful to suggest. Or God forbid, it might
merely show "promise." Having Bella not rave about its towering
brilliance would be reason enough for a weirdly deluded andvulnerable student to kill himself. So there she would be, finding areason to live while dealing with her guilt and perhaps turning thatinto some new productive work of her own. How ironic and how far
more satisfying than what we're given.
The worst possibility is that the entire evening is just a story being
made up on the spot by Bella as she wanders in the night. That would</p>
<p>be fine, though the story she's telling has lots of inconsistencies. (See
above.) Plus, it would be better if the show gracefully and openly
acknowledged that fact; heck a meta ending might be satisfying as we
realize this particular story is an act of imagination. Any sense of being
"cheated" would be calmed by Rapp reminding us that every play isprecisely that and nothing more.
For the many complaints the ending raises, none can be raised about
the two actors. Hochman is very good. And Mary-Louise Parker is a
joy. Both break the fourth wall, though Parker has the bulk of the workto do here, narrating her own story while guiding us through the upsand downs of her narrow, unhappy life. Deadpan, deadly serious, and
deadly funny, Parker is wholly naturalistic throughout, never calling
attention to herself. That's why you can't take your eyes off her.
In one scene, Parker is in a bar alone and chatting up a guy. The way
she looks at him faux agreeably and then turns back to us is hilariousand speaks volumes. They go back to his miserable hotel to have sex,
which she narrates to marvelous effect, including the fact that the TV
is on the entire time and showing a rerun of Everybody  LovesRaymond  in which....   Here Parker squints as she struggles to make
out the TV screen and tells us they're in the kitchen as Ray's wifeannounces she's invited both of her divorced parents for Thanksgivingdinner. That squint, that moment in which Parker is so present in the
scene she's creating for us by herself on stage, is so typical of her
greatness. (Again, the technical team is right there with her every stepof the way.)
Another is the scene where Bella joins her students in an exercise and
finds herself writing the same sentence over and over again: Listen tothe sound inside. Listen to the sound inside. Parker repeats it over andover, the words fill up the stage in a beautiful projection by AaronRhyne and the effect is hypnotic. When it's over, Bella drolly admits, "I
have no idea what it means." Well, I have no idea what it means
either. And I have no idea what Rapp was thinking at the end. Out ofunpromising stuff, he crafted a thoroughbred of a play that breaksyour heart by stumbling just before the finish line. But with this castand creative team, she's a beauty to watch while she runs.
