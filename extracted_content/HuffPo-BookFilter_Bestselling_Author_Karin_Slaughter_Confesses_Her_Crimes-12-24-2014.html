After writing 14 bestsellers featuring a memorable cast ofcharacters, she delivered a "stand alone," that is, a book with new characters that isn't part of an ongoing series.Called Cop Town, it's set in the 1970s and features Kate Murphy, a new rookie female cop joining the force anddesperate to keep her privileged background a secret. Kate is paired with a tough veteran named MaggieLawson, a blue blood in the only sense that counts to other cops: a blue collar worker from a family ofpolicemen.Cop Town has been named one of the best books of the year by Amazon. Gillian Flynn says Slaughter is "oneof the best thriller writers working today." And Michael Connelly says, "If you haven't read her yet, this is themoment."Slaughter has been publishing books to serious acclaim and sales since her debut with Blindsighted in 2001.That proved to be the launch of a series set in a small town in Georgia which combined the bleak landscape ofcrime with real characters whose lives are continually shattered and rebuilt by the violence they witness orsometimes suffer directly. Each book offers a new horror for the folk of fictional Grant County to face. But whenthese gripping thrillers are intertwined with the drama of their personal lives -- the town's coroner is a womanwho divorced her husband the sheriff when he cheated on her -- it becomes addictive reading. More importantly,it shows the lasting effect of brutal crimes on both the victims, their family and friends and even the police whoinvestigate. This isn't a world where bad guys are punished and all returns to normal: the aftershocks of a crimecommitted in her first book have a subtle ripple effect on everyone right up to the present.That first award-winning series led to a second one set in Atlanta and then both came together in her last fewbooks which merged the two worlds Slaughter had created. With 30 million copies sold worldwide and Slaughterhitting the top of the bestseller list in numerous countries, she is apparently just getting started. Cop Town is outnow in hardcover. If you're a paperback lover, that version comes out January 27. And then a new standalonenovel called Pretty Girls is due out in July.In Cop Town, a cop killer is on the loose and the entire force of Atlanta is out for blood, ready to bend or breakany rules in their desire to avenge the deaths of their own and stop a madman. Slaughter illuminates countlessdivides: rich and poor, women and men and even among the beleaguered female cops (who eye each otherwarily across racial lines).An engaging presence, Slaughter is also a smart and passionate advocate for the issues she subtly raises in herbooks. Here's Slaughter talking about the genuine dangers female cops faced when joining the police force inthe face of hostile male resistance.Of course, with fame comes the inevitable spotlight on your private life. So Slaughter happily confessed whenasked to talk about the first crime she ever committed.</p>
