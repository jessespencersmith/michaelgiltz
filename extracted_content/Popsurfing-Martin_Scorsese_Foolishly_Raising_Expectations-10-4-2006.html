            <p>W E D N E S D AY,  O C TO B E R  0 4 ,  2 0 0 6Martin Scorsese: Foolishly Raising ExpectationsMartin Scorsese's fun-looking gangster drama "The Departed" opensFriday. A smart producer or studio executive would always downplayexpectations. But what does Marty's producer Graham King tell theDaily News? That he expects the movie to open at $30 million, thatmore than $40 million would make him very happy and that he'd cry ifit made $25 million or less. How stupid is he? Scorsese's top-grossingmovie of all time is "The Aviator," which made $102 million. Theweekend it went wide, the movie grossed $8.6 million. His otherrelatively big openings -- "Gangs of New York," "Casino," and "CapeFear" -- all made between $9 million and $10 million. King has set thebar so high, he wants this movie to make more money on its openingweekend than 12 of his movies have made in their entire run. If he wassmart, King would have said he hopes the movie makes more on itsopening weekend than Scorsese's last few movies made when they wentwide; in other words, looking for a personal best of $12-15 million.Then, when "The Departed" made more, everyone could crow abouthow much better it did. At it's very best, "The Departed" will only(barely) reach the level King has announced as the measure of success.Dumb, dumb, dumb.NOTE: The Departed opened at $26.8 mil -- easily a career-best forScorsese -- and went on to gross $133 million in the US, $290 millionworldwide (incl US) and $140 million on DVD in the US alone, allrecords for Scorsese.EDITOR'S NOTE: I have changed the figures in my article about theopening weekend gross of The Aviator and hence the references toScorsese's personal best opening weekend. I based my original figureson Variety but failed to note they were giving me the grosses for theentire week rather than the opening weekend. Thus my figures werewrong as pointed out to me by someone who left a comment. Thismakes the point of the article even greater: King idiotically called for anopening weekend gross 3 to 4 times bigger than any other Scorsesefilm.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT 4:15 PM
