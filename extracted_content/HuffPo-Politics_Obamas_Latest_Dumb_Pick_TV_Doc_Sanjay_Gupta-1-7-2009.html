Apparently, Marcus Welby is too old and Noah
Wylie of ER wants a break because BarackObama's pick for Surgeon General  is CNN"s
Sanjay Gupta.  This is dismaying since Gupta has
embraced junk science, has questionable ethicsand seems to have been chosen mostly becausehe is famous. Forget a Team of Rivals: this is thelatest example of Obama's Team of Celebrities.
First, Gupta. I don't watch him regularly but I
assume (and hope) most of his medicalcommentary falls well within standard norms.
But I was aghast when I heard him talk about cell phones and say he was too afraid to use onewithout an ear piece. Surely the Surgeon General should take a strong stand against junk scienceand unreasonable fears. The argument by Gupta and others when it comes to cell phones is sure,there's absolutely no sound scientific evidence they can be damaging and of course believing theycan cause cancer goes against everything we know about non-ionizing radiation, but still...younever know. By this logic, there's no reason to be afraid of your TV set but why not watch yourfavorite shows from behind the couch, just to be safe? Unless you're also afraid of the AM/FMradio signals that bombard you every day, afraid of grocery store item scanners, afraid of thesignals that zap you every time you walk in and out of a store so they can check for security devices,there is no sound scientific medical reason to be afraid of your cell phone. If you want to be on thesafe side, you should also wear aluminum foil on your head, "just in case."
Gupta also came out on the losing end in my opinion when trying to attack Michael Moore's
documentary Sicko.  His initial report on the film and subsequent debate with Moore led to CNN
having to issue corrections fixing Gupta's errors. They never spotlighted a single factual error byMoore but simply took issue with how Moore cherrypicked the data he cited. Here is CNN's

description of their back-and-forth on the facts.
But I'm far more concerned about Gupta's questionable ethics. According to the New York Times ,
Gupta accepts paid speaking engagements, something no journalist worth their salt would do --
and a practice banned by most media outlets. Why CNN allows this of one of their reporters is amystery to me, but it means Gupta's conflicts of interest probably stretch from here to Kalamazoo.You can't call yourself a journalist and take money from people you're supposedly reporting on.
Finally, I'm most concerned because the only valid reason I can think of for Obama choosing
Gupta is that he's on TV. Certainly, Obama needs someone to challenge him on medical issues:
Obama's medical disclosure was shamefully inadequate during the election. (Basically, he offered
up a note from his doctor insisting that Obama was fine.) Let's hope that's not a pattern, just like
the selection of Gupta seems a pattern. Bush wallowed in cronyism. I hoped Obama would
embrace competence. But that's hardly been the case.
Why was Bill Richardson picked for Secretary of Commerce? Given the state of our economy, I
would expect Obama to pick someone who lived and breathed commerce and was bursting withsmart, progressive ideas about how to stimulate the economy and get us back on track. Instead, bytheir own admission, Richardson's biggest asset seems to have been his high profile and hisHispanic roots. (Aren't two Hispanics in the Cabinet enough of a show of respect?) Certainly,commerce has not been the laser-like focus of Richardson over the years.
Why was Leon Panetta picked as head of the CIA? (And what possible reason could there be for
keeping Diane Feinstein out of the loop  on it?) Panetta has zero intelligence experience and even
his own supporters agree he'll need to have a staff of advisers who are well-grounded in theintelligence community. Gee, you think? I'd like to imagine that ALL the top people at the CIA hada strong background in intelligence. Panetta's main qualification seems to have been that he's well-known, a celebrity in political circles. Rather breathtakingly, Obama's people insist that one ofPanetta's qualifications is that he received intelligence briefings from the CIA when he was theWhite House Chief of Staff. In other words, because he received briefings from the CIA, he's nowqualified to run the CIA. I often read Supreme Court rulings. I guess that means I'm ready to bethe Chief Justice.
And how about the hate-mongerer Rick Warren? Did Obama choose to honor a person of faith at
his inauguration that reflected his own personal values, someone that celebrated the diversity ofthis country and showed a respect for people of other faiths and even people of no faith? No, hechose Warren, a man who actively attacks the beliefs of most Americans, spreads hate about gays
by comparing them to pedophiles and incest, lies about it, also lied about Prop 8 by insisting he
would be thrown in jail if it didn't pass and on and on. So why did Obama choose him? Because
Warren is a celebrity. He's famous. Lots of people know him. And even if Warren's beliefs are
antithetical to those of most Americans and certainly most of Obama's actual supporters, fame
outstrips everything else.
Maybe Sanjay Gupta will prove an effective Surgeon General, if he accepts. He's certainly an
effective communicator, a smart man, and an Emmy-winning, best-selling author and celebrity.
But first he'll need to clean up his questionable ethics, junk the junk science and embrace thescientific and medical community.
What do you think of Gupta as Surgeon General? Any other Obama picks you're disappointed in?UPDATE: The New York Times blogs about the debate over Gupta, with links to articles and
comments that mention Gupta has also waffled on issues like vaccines and autism, opposes
medical marijuana, is considered by many on the left to be in the pocket of big pharma, opposesuniversal health care, played up the risks of Avian flu in the US to scare up ratings, and other caseswhere he might be cowtowing to irrational fears or entrenched interests rather than siding with thescientific community.

Michael,
Entertainment, politics, sports and religion is your beat. But not biology. Proclaiming something "junkscience" without actually investigating it, understanding who's doing it, funding it, been knocked out ofthe game, or has the appropriate credentials to evaluate it---is risky. Sure, physical scientists are likelyto say wireless radiation is harmless, because the energy is too low to heat tissue or knock electronsoff their orbit, and because there are studies are inconsistent. But biologists know biological systemsare inconsistent, and that they respond to chemical and subtle electromagnetic signals. A pathogen ortoxin doesn't have to have the force of a club to bring a biological system down. A small, constantirritant over time--interrupting repair mechanisms, inducing stress proteins, or opening the blood-brain
barrier---can add up. Your outlook sounds more influenced by industry PR than by actual knowledge of
the science---and the politics surrounding it.

I'm sure Gupta has had to watch his words carefully re wireless health because it's a dicey
political/legal topic, and because the hair-trigger response of some is to make light of it. But it's a
serious concern, especially re children, as acknowledged by the E.U., Germany, Finland, the former UKHealth chief, and France, which is about to place bans on advertising and selling cellphones to
children.

Hi Michael, 
I agree with all you said, though you forgot to mention Tim Kaine at DNC.When I first read about Gupta as Surgeon General, I was sure it was a joke, but my ha ha ha quickly
became WTF?! 
My guess is that Gupta, along with Warren, are Obama's way of trying to reach out to middle America,
the masses, or whatever he calls us. Message to Obama: we are way smarter than you think we are.

Perhaps Sen. Feinstein was kept out of the loop re: Panetta because of the bungled job that she andher committee have done during the past administration. Since she heads the committee that didn'tverify the WMDs or any number of other bits of intelligence, why should she be consulted about thenew CIA chief? 
Maybe Pres.-elect Obama has sent a signal to her, Sen. Rockefeller, and the others who let this nation
down by their shoddy oversight.

But is Surgeon General really THAT serious of a position? It's not even a part of the cabinet. If I were
going to pick a famous Doc I'd pick Dr. Andrew Weil, who I find to be fair, grounded in science and yetwilling to look into safe alternative treatments that work. With Big Pharma the way it is, I'd like to seesomeone who is steeped in preventative medicine.Or that Dr. Oz from those "You...!" books.

Obama won the election in large part because the economy crashed and moderate Republicans couldnot bring themselves to vote for a Palin ticket. When the economy rights itelf or does not right itself,either way, he will no longer have such a large win margin. The next Republican who is more moderatewill have a good chance at taking the white house in 2012. This is why Obama is running hard and fastto right of center and is selecting celebrity figures. He intends to use the media to brainwash Americansinto believing whatever he sells is the change we wanted. Hence his attraction to Dr. Gupa and Warren
and Tim Kaine.
By 2012, Obama will have a record to view and not just beautiful speech smattered with a light record.
In 2012, Obama will likely hit the Republican and evangelical wall he is so trying to break down. Theloss of progressive support could very well end his Presidency. My guess is that Obama's picks aremore about Obama winning in 2012 then anyone would like to think.

Sicko is the greatest movie made - I grew up in the UK and the health care was incredible. It's notsocialism, anyone with money or a good job buys into BUPA private health care which is forced to beamazing as they are competing with a free service.
The fact that Obama picked a critic of the movie disappoints me as the change this country needs really
isn't someone else who will be in the pocket of the pharma industry.
Dr Joel Fuhrman's Eat To Live book literally changed my life and ridded me of headaches, anxiety,
extra weight and hypoglycemia - with obesity in this country reaching a 60% level it would have been
nice for him to pick out someone who would focus on preventative medicine such as healthy lifestylechanges rather than spending billions on avoidable problems such as heart disease or obesity.
Obama has been disappointing me lately with this choice, and Warren so let's see how he does in
office. I understand he is trying to bring in people who represent the country as a whole but this is ourtime, the Democratic administration and there should be no tolerance for ignorance.
leopoldmozart See Profile  I'm a Fan of leopoldmozart  permalink
I totally agree. It would have been wonderful if he had chosen someone like Dr. Dean Ornishor Dr. Joel Fuhrman; a physician who also greatly appreciates the role of diet and lifestyle inour health.

There is no doubt that PE Obama selected Gupta because he is a celebrity, communicator, whatever.Frankly I still think Sanjay will turn him down in the end because there's just no money in theappointment. It is also true that it is the Administration that will set health care policy. I am in a wait andsee mode regarding the new Administration. Having voted for Obama and been disillusioned by the
selection of Rick Warren for the inauguration invocation I am still willing to give Obama the benefit of
the doubt. Rick Warren, Sanjay Gupta and the appointment of the Surgeon General are just not at thetop of my list of priorities. The Leon Panetta appointment might prove somewhat more troubling. But
even then, compared to what? The trampling of the constitution, democracy and human decency by the
Bush Administration knows no equal.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
I agree wholeheartedly. Obama just has to do a so-so job in order to look brilliant comparedto Bush. And if he actually obeys the law? Bonus! Neither Gupta nor Warren are veryimportant in the scheme of things, with Warren being an especially transitory (if annoying)choice.

Personally, I don't expect the general public to have a "pick" for Surgeon General. Iassume the top ten or 20 or 100 best people for the job who would be huge starswould be pretty much unknown to people outside the medical establishment likemyself. Hence my surprise when he picked Gupta.

Gupta's exchange with Michael Moore, where he used lies, rhetoric and bluster to try to win the debateshowed an absence of integrity on his part. Also, he was hopelessly unprepared when he appeared onLarry King with Jenny McCarthy to discuss autism, and his "gee, golly, who really knows?" waffling onthe connection between autism and vaccines was shameful and embarrassing. (In case you'reinterested, there is absolutely positively certainly no evidence that autism is caused by vaccines.Something is causing the rise of autism, parkinson's, and alzheimer's, and it is crucial for the health ofour children and elderly that we find what it is, but it is ABSOLUTELY NOT VACCINES.)

Surgeon General developed a tradition of integrity and honesty, sometimes embarrassingly so. Gupta
deviates from that tradition.
