$ ndrew Lippa's Off-Broadway musi-
$ft cal "The Wild Parly" has deserved
SSto be revived in NewYork since it
H Ssquared off in 2000 with a compet-
ing musical based on the same story. Ac-
tress Nicole Sterling was going to Broad-
way in Stephen Sondheim's "Bounce"
when thot show closed out of town. Now
both have found a home Off-Off-Broad-
way at the Gallery Players, a Brooklyn
institution for more than 40 vears.' '.{
re
Atiny but thdving space in Puk Slope, Brooklyn, the
Gallery Players hm shom a knack for clever revivals of
Broadway shows that pack in audiences for the brief, 16-
perfomance run allowed by its Showcase agreement
with Acto$ Equity (an agrcement that also specifies an
$18 ticket price for the gg-seat space).
The Gallery Players doesn't just draw in new audienc-
es; it also appeals to working actors who see the short
runs and high-quality material as the perfect opportunity
to do what they love and maybe get spotted by directors,
producers and casting agents in the audienceSterling was already a fan of Lippa's "The Wild Party"
- a musical about doomed Jzz Age lovere impired by
a then-scandalous 1928 poem by Miter Joseph Moncure
March, which was reissued in 1994 with vibrant black-
and-white illustrations by Art Spiegelman - when she
heard Gallery Players would be mounlingitFeb-2-24
"I used some of the music for auditions in the Dast and
it serves me really well," says Sterling. who miss-ed the
show during its Off-Broadway run but loved the cast al-
bum She was also familiar with the Gallery having seen
a friend perform there a few years ago
"It's wonderful to go to a rehearsal and be with people
who are all on the same page," says Sterling, who plays
Queenie, the hard-drinking center ofthe show "The
whole point of a showcase is to show New York some of</p>
<p>at the National Alliance for Musical Theater. "Itf s very
attractive for them to have the opportunity to work on
a show like'The Wild Party,'which has great featured
roles. And directors, producers and casting people are
here, so there's a better chance they'Il see your work."
Formed in 1967 (a teenage Harvey Fierstein was one of
the founders), the Gallery Players has been a showcase
for Fierstein and others, including directorJohn Rando
(a TonyAward winner for "Urinetown') and actress De-
idre Goodwin (part of the current Broadway revival of
",A Chorus Line'). It also nurtures talent with a new play-
wright festival; mounting a recent, critically acclaimed
production of the appealing new musical'Yank!" (by Da-
vid and Joseph ZelInk), which is sure to have a future lifeOff-Broadway; and programs for kids and teenagers.
Most of all, it's a place for a talent like Sterling to re-
member why she does theater in the first place.
"I got that dose of reality right off the bat," Sterling says
with a laugh about her time in Sondheim's "Bounce," a
great opportunif5i even if it didn't have the long life one
would expect for a new musical from a theatrical giant.
"Doing the Gallery Players, it's just about we're here
because we want to be here and we want to do a show that
we all care about and do the best job we can. We don't
have to think about, 'Does this sell? Are people going to
like this?'We just do it." t

Fourth and Fifth Avenues, Parh Slope; 7 1 8-59 5-0547.)
the talent they might not otherwise see because we're out
of the way. There's tons of talent that goes unnoticed."
For Matt Schicker, Gallery Players executive director
and president, that's the focus of the company he has vol-
unteered at for more than five years. (-iterally everyone
involved works for free, with the actors receMng only the
most basic expenses, Iike travel money.)
"There are a million performers in New York and only
so many jobs," says Schicker, who lives two blocks from
the Gallery Players space in Park Slope and also works</p>
