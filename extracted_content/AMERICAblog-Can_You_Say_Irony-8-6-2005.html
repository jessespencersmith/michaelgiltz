8/06/2005 12:56:00 PMOk, the irony here is almost too thick to enjoy. The BushAdministration has filed charges against two Israeli lobbyistsfor leaking classified info to the media. Uh, did ANYONEconsider how this would look with Bush currently coddling KarlRove after he and at least two or three top adminstrationofficials did the very same thing? Did anyone grill Scotty on thisor did I miss it?To further the irony, many believe Bush is twisting the intent ofthe law to prosecute people here for behavior that is bothcommon and not a threat. Unlike Rove, who leaked info thatendangered lives and ruined a spy network developed over 20years, these lobbyists were just giving a heads-up to peopleabout a report they thought was interesting. No, lobbyists don'tget to decide what is classified info and what isn't, but in anadministration that classifies virtually everything it can, there'sa difference between the usual back and forth between thegov't and lobbyists and media and the unconscionable act ofouting a covert CIA agent for the first time in history just togive some payback to a critic for telling the truth.
