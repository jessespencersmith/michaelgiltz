CANNES 2001: Racing for Recognition ; First 
Films Strive for Cannes' Camera d'Or 
by Michael Giltz 
(indieWIREI 05.14.01) -A fnend of a friend stood in the lobby 
of the Debussy as crowds streamed oul arMou)in Rouge"and 
told me excitedly thana libertad"( "Freedom') was really 
good. I later found Qut thai the director had been standing 
right by him when he said this. Perhaps that explains his 
enthusiasm; Ihe movie certainly didn'\. 
That's the way with Cannes. When it's a good year, everyone 
seems to be talking about the screenings you missed: the 
rapturous applause. the raves in the trades, the countless 
reporters who couldn') even get in. When it's a bad year, 
everyone is talking in Godot-like terms aboullhe movies thaI 
haven'! screened yet. 
This year's talk about the Camera O'Or race. those films 
screening by first-time directors. is still about the movies to 
come. They may never arrive (at least artistically). but the first 
efforts that have already been shown demonstrate more of a 
debt to the past than the wave of the future. 
"La libertad"is a prime eKample Its debtts owed to Satyajit 
Ray. who knew how to tum the smallest of incidents into 
gripping drama. Writer-director lisandro Alonso. however, 
forgot the incident. He simply shows a day in the life of an 
Argentine peasant who makes his living chopping wood alone 
in a forest. We see the man chop down wood. sell it. buy 
some supplies, ask the store clerk if there are any girls around 
(there aren't). try and visit someone who isn', around and then 
90 home and cook an armadillo. 
Alonso steadfastly avoids even the slightest of plot lines -no 
tree threatens to fall on our protagon ist and even the armadillo 
is caught off-camera. Still, Alonso manages to frame his shots 
with enough intelligence to keep a dedicated viewer from 
losing complete inl8f'est. (SEARCH)

<p>Far more promising -and the frontrunner for the Camera O'Or 
after the first five days -is"Atanarjuat, The Fast 
Runner"{Canada), A commanding drama by documentary 
filmmaker Zacharias Kunuk, this nearly three-hour film tells 
the fable-like story about when evil comes to an Inuit village, 
Problems persist when Atanarjuat falls for the pretty girl 
promised to the mean-spirited Oki, son of the village leader, 
Atanarjuat gets his way, and the festering resentment of Oki 
leads to treachery by his two-faced sister and eventually 
murder, 
Obviously, one thinks of Robert Flaherty, but Kunuk's 
involving tale stands on its own -thanks to touches that 
embrace Inuit myths and the crystal clarity of the images 
captured by cinematographer Norman Cohn, It earned the 
emphatic, insistent applause of an audience that was 
convinced it had finally seen something worthwhile , 
No enthusiasm could be found for"Chelsea Walls,"Ethan 
Hawke's directorial debut. A jumble of storylines, it skips back 
and forlh between current denizens of the Chelsea Hotel, with 
an all-star cast featuring Kris Kristofferson as an alcoholic 
writer, Miranda Richardson as his currenl name, Vincent 
D'Onofrio as a shy painter who tries to date Uma Thurman , 
and Robert Sean Leonard and Steve Zahn as struggling 
musicians, 
Shot on DV by Tom Richmond in association with Richard 
Rutowski, the movie embraces its muddy, rough origins. And 
the music that dominates throughout is far more interesting 
than any of the stories. Hawke's debt is to the Beatniks and it 
remains unpaid. His investors are another story: the trades 
reported the rights to France were sold for S350.OO0, which 
was more than the entire budge\. 
"Fah Talai Jone"("Tears of the Black Tiger") was snapped up 
by Miramax and it's easy to see why. This fillip on Thai 
westerns (who knew?) has a wonderfully kitschy look thanks 
to a colorful production design by Ake Aimchuen and a tinted 
print that provides a surreal touch. Indeed, Ihe look of the film 
is the only consistent draw. Perhaps Miramax can speed the 
storyline up with its fabled scissors. For now, wri\er-director 
Wisit Sasanatieng's film uncomfortably straddles the line 
between homage and satire. 
More serious and more effective is the black-humored 
Bosnian Competition entry"No Man's Land"by director Danis 
Tanovic. like most of the overtly political films at the festival, 
this one is heavy-handed in the extreme, but tile main story is 
compelling enough to overcome its forced style. Two soldiers 
on opposite sides of Ihe '93 Bosnian connict are trapped in No 
Man's Land. Their stand-off seems unending, with only a UN 
Captain willing 10 intervene (despite orders 10 the contrary). A 
third soldier, thought dead, is actually trapped on top of a land . , .. -... .... ,</p>

on to this story, adding to the absurd atmosphere that hopes 
to mack not simply this particular war, but all wars. The film 
definltely has its supporters. 
"Ca,"however, does not. A mildly sweet debut from Roman 
Coppola, he is not -as yet -prepared to follow In his slste(s 
footsteps. Coppola's sister, of course, is Sofia, who scored 
strong critical reviews and a solid art·house hit with her debut 
feature"The Virgin Suicides."(1t even had a great soundtrack 
courtesy of Air.) Roman takes the more obvious route of 
creating an homage to classics like"S 1f2" and"La Dolce 
Vita"in telling his tale of a"Barbarella"style movie shoot in '60s 
Paris. The cast is formidable, including Gerard Depardieu and 
Jeremy Davies. But the comparisons to those masterpieces 
are not favorable and, Indeed, Roman quietly mocks his own 
pretensions. But not enough. 
Equally toothless is"Amour D'enfance"("Childhood Loves"), 
the uninvolving story of Paul, a man who returns to the family 
farm when his father is dying. Paul also hooks up with some 
boring old friends he'd left behind long ago and for good 
reason. Finally, his former girlfriend is out of town, but her little 
sister is looking better and better as the days drag on. Director 
Yves Caumon doesn't have much to work with, but he pulls an 
exceptional performance from Laury! Brossier as Odile, the 
little sister. Her scenes -flushing with embarrassment when 
Paul says he knows she had a crosh on him -are sparked 
with lile. Caumon either has a way with female actresses or 
simply has a good eye for talent. but his next movie will be 
worth watching if only for that reason. And certainly so will 
Brossie(s. 
The more highly anticipated movies in the Camera d'Or race 
have yet to screen:"lovely Rita."Jessica Hausne(s intimate 
look at an awkward high school girl who's ready to explore her 
burgeoning sexuality from Austria. and Fine line's elaborate 
comedy"Human Nature"directed by Michel Gondry, and 
written by Charlie Kaufman. that stars Tim Robbins and 
Patricia Arquette as scientists who wrestle with how to handle 
the wild child played by Rhys Ifans. 
Finally, the wild card in all of this is·Shrek,"the DreamWorks 
animated flick that played to very strong applause at the 
lumiere and received across-the·board raves from the trades. 
("Variety"had only minor quibbles to make about the dull third 
act.) A distinctive looking. highly commercial effort, it tells of 
an ogre who must rescue a fairy princess in order to get a little 
peace and quiet. 
Certainly, animation has enjoyed a creative flowering in the 
last two decades and Cannes should reflect that. But instead 
of"Beauty and the Beast.""Toy Story .. ·Chicken Run."or 
even"South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut,"they settled 
",,·C::h...,.~ "Th,,"G in ... h"." ... ,,, .. f ... r<onn"G , .. hi ... h I<o~' f",,', ,.......t</p>

such lesser·animated movies like'The Fantastic Planet"and 
Disney's woeful"Peter Pan." 
While the best animated movies are RaVOfed with witty 
asides,"Shre k"is nothing but pop-<;ulturat riffs. Some day. 
perhaps. the scene where Shrek uses wresUing moves 10 
trounce his opponents to the tune of Joan Jelt's"Bad 
Repulation"will seem like a witty spoof on"A Knight's Tale."ln 
fact. il's just an example of this movie's dull heart. But given 
the strong crowd response and the stellar reviews. the two 
directors (Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson) may 
conceivably find their fairy tale Includes a Camera d'Or fOf the 
happy ending.
