 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyCrime Thriller 'The Kings Of Cool' Is
Bloody Good Fun
THE KINGS OF COOL  *** out of ****
By Don Winslow
$25.00
336 pages; Simon & Schuster
With Savages , author Don Winslow  transformed
himself from an author into a franchise. Critics and fellow writers had enjoyed his playfully funny and
brutal crime novels like The Winter Of Frankie Machine  for years.
But Savages  pulled out all the stops. Winslow rolled the dice on every level with sexy, smart characters;
short, sharp, shocked chapters; dips into the screenplay form (because everyone thinks in terms ofmovies now); and even goofing around with punctuation and spacing, letting a thoughtslide down a pageuntil it hit the punchline.
Get it? Stephen King compared it to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid  (see, a movie!) and no wonder.
The story centered on two guys and a girl: Ben, Chon and Ophelia, aka O. Ben is a super-smart liberal,
Chon an ex-military conservative, O a child of privilege and they're all living the high life. Literally.
Ben and Chon serve up primo marijuana in as many flavors as Ben & Jerry's, with Ben doing social work
in Third World countries on the side for his karma and Chon always ready to dish out violence becauseturning the other cheek gets old fast in the drug trade. In Savages , they found themselves facing off
against a Mexican cartel that not only wanted their turf but insisted the lads come work for them. Itskittered to a memorable finale, and if the Oliver Stone movie is half as jazzed up on their sexy fatalism,it could be a blast and bring Winslow even more fans.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>They would do well to start with this prequel, The Kings Of Cool,  before reading Savages  or seeing the
movie. It has all the snap and savvy of Savages  but with even more ambition and heart. Here we get the
origin story of Ben and Chon and O, along with flashbacks to the '60s for the origin story of the drug
trade in California. As is only hinted at in Savages , this involves their parents to a surprising degree.
Surfers, free love, messed up parenting, communes, therapy and more all combine to propel first theparents and then the children into drug dealing. Winslow also artfully shows how the game changes alongwith the drugs: the mellowness of pot slides into the trippy-ness of acid which burns into the stinging
nastiness of cocaine. The money gets bigger, the stakes get higher and the violence turns from an off-
screen flirtation into a live-in lover.
Savages  was fun but The Kings of Cool  has more emotional weight. Parents betray -- or, worse, simply
fail -- their children. Children must decide whether their loyalty lies with biology or those they've bonded
with. And the multi-generational arc of the story (we go back and forth in time throughout) showsWinslow's ambitions have risen along with his success. From watching Ben seduce a federal agent intobecoming his paid informant to watching O literally seduce first one and then the other dude of herdreams, we are entranced.
Winslow even humanizes a beautiful gold-digger named Kim, showing the drive and determination it
takes to leap from dismal trailer park to dissatisfied trophy wife. Winslow himself has probably justpulled off the same trick: graduating from well-reviewed writer to a name brand author who delivers thegoods. Let's hope they don't share the same fate because in Winslow's world, ambition -- even ambitionspiked with good intentions -- almost always proves fatal.

Great. Hope you enjoy it; definitely a quick, violent, stylistically accessible but playful
summer read.

 Amazing Inspiring Funny Scary Hot Crazy Important WeirdTheater: Last Smoker In America
Huffs & Puffs But No Nicotine Fix
THE LAST SMOKER IN AMERICA  ** out of ****
WESTSIDE THEATRE
A very game cast cannot overcome the inert nature of
this musical satire about a society obsessed with denyingdrinking and smoking and playing video games and
eating (and eating and eating) and all the other fun
indulgences that may not be good for you but sure make life fun. The show begins with an AA meeting of
sorts where a husband (Ernie) admits his wife is still struggling with addiction to nicotine, quite the
problem since even possessing a cigarette can get you tossed in the slammer. We hear an ode to the "last
smoker in America." In the middle of the show, that woman, Pam (Farah Alvin) is still the defiant lastsmoker in America. And at the end of the show, some not so shocking revelations have been revealed andthe plot has been twisted but Pam is still the last smoker in America.
Similarly, Ernie (the likable John Bolton) begins the show as an unemployed man who is a frustrated
rock star penning awful songs in the basement of their home. And in the middle he's dishing out nutty
tunes like "Straight White Man." At the end? He's still rocking out. Their neighbor? She's an over-
zealous Christian named Phyllis (Natalie Venetia Belcon) so no points for guessing she'll turn out to be ahypocrite. And Pam and Ernie's son is consistently inconsistent since the book by Bill Russell changes its
mind every five minutes about what that kid, Jimmy (Jake Boyd) should be.
It's only 90 minutes but the show feels padded since the very slight idea powering it goes nowhere and
the songs (lyrics by Russell and music by Peter Melnick) can only muster up so many ways to sing the
praises of tobacco.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>The set is anonymously suburban without being quite sitcom-ish or retro enough to get across any
satirical ideas. But it gets the job done, though the talking smoke alarm is very tiresome as written anddesigned. Ditto the costumes by Michael McDonald, which have a little fun with an Osmonds sequence
and Jimmy's rapper phase. Director Andy Sandberg wisely moves things along as quickly as possible,
hoping the more plates he tosses in the air the less likely we'll notice there's not much on the menu.
A few songs linger in the mind, especially "You're The Only Friend I've Got," which does a nice job of
illustrating all the desires of the four characters and how they're sublimated and another tune with a nice'50s pop song arrangement that -- like the opener -- shows off the cast's strong voices.
But mostly it's the actors you'll remember since they make the most of the rather thin proceedings and
even in a way triumph. Alvin has a certain Frances McDormand quality that's very appealing while
Bolton has an everyman charm and a wailing rock star squeal that's probably half the reason he got the
part. But because they have to carry the burden of the plot, they can't have quite as much fun as thesupporting actors.
Belcon has the most fun here as the nosy neighbor Phyllis. She sings in a smoothed out upper register
when in cheery mode but drops down to a lower register to signal disapproval or desire and gets a laugh
most every time. She's also the character with the clearest motivation: she's in love with Ernie and jealous
of the life Pam has and literally wants to move in and take over. That gives her the most to work with as acharacter and Belcon scores as much as possible, though Phyllis's hypocrisy is so pat it's kind of a bore.
The creators probably want to pretend the teen Jimmy is trying to find himself like most teens. But in fact
their book just flips through identities with an annoying randomness. In the first scene, Jimmy is awhiny kid on serious medication. In his second scene, he struts around like a rapper and insists he'sblack. In the third he's addicted to video games and somewhat back to his old self with the rapper thang
vaguely referenced to every once in a while when it might get a cheap laugh. Later he's a zoned out
medication zombie and then a transvestite because that's always good for a transgressive vibe. It's a small
miracle that the very appealing Boyd makes any sense of the role at all, much less squeezes out laughs
with his sharp timing (though that Osmond outfit helps). He also vocally bounces around with ease fromthe faux rap of "Gangsta" to the more traditional Broadway belting. (I don't know why he was on thekitchen table licking the puppy dog-shaped cookie jar at one point but it sure made me laugh.)
A flat, would-be outrageous ending doesn't help matters in the least, but that shouldn't obscure the fact
that while the musical isn't worthy of them (where there's smoke, there's not always fire) they are a
talented quartet.
