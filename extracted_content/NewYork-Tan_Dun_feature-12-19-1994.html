            <p>Tale eimagining America 
Like many immigrants, Chinese composer Tan Dun identi­
fies with two worlds. "My last trip back to China was in 
January, after seven years," he says. "Before, I thought 
of New York as my home. But this time, to feel so warmly about 
China was a big shock. I felt, 'This is my home; now I have two 
homes.' " 
Tan's ability to find a sense of place in both cultures is rare. 
Most immigrants feel adrift, and that dislocation is at the heart 
of America Dreaming, a collab­
oration with Japanese·Ameri· 
can writer Chiori Miyagawa 
now in previews at the Vine­
yard Theatre. It's about the 
Japanese-born Yuki, who mar· 
ries an American named 
Robert and struggles to forge 
an identity. 
It's the first pure theater 
piece for Tan, who's finishing 
up a work for the Kronos Quar­
t~ and was recently named 
the composer in residence for 
the BBC Scottish Symphony. 
Performances of Tan's music 
often involve intriguing, vague­
ly religious rituals, and America Dreaming is no exception. ''The 
most interesting thing for me, always, is something abstract, 
surrealistic, extremely mysterious, and very, very spiritual," he 
says. "We're using the text of 'The Star Spangled Banner,' but 
just the words. We've recomposed all kinds of melodies for it, 
from Bulgarian to Chinese to Japanese to jazz. For me, the 
music structure itseH represents America Dreaming. At the 
beginning, melodies are sung one by one; but at the end, all the 
multinational melodies overlap." MICHAEl. GILTZ</p>
