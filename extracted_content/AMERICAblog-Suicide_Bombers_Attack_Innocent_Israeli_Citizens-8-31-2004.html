8/31/2004 03:12:00 PMI don't care where you stand on the Israeli-Palestinian debate, suicidebombers are immoral and despicable and should be condemned atevery step. They undermine the moral legitimacy of the Palestiniansand target innocent people. Isn't the biggest attack on Israeli men,women, and children in six months -- 15 dead so far and more than85 wounded -- shameful? Does it compare to targeted Israeli attacksagainst top Palestinian militia people which try to minimize civiliancasualties? No.So is this the latest front in the war on terror (which we can or can'twin, depending on which Bush quote you want to use)? Or, as somewould have you believe, is the fact that we defend and support Israel(the only legitimate democracy in the Middle East) the only reasonthere's a war on terror in the first place?
