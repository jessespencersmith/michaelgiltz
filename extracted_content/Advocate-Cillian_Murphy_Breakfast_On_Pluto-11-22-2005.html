Hot off rave reviews from 
summer hits Batman Begins 
and Red Eye, Irish actor Cillian 
Murphy does drag for Crying 
Game director Neil Jordan in 
Breakfast on Pluto 
By Michael Giltz 
THE ADVOCATE MOst men do serious grooming the day before their wedding. But it 
was the day after his wedding that actor Cillian Murphy began 
some serious primping-namely eyebrow-plucking and chest­
and leg-hair removal worthy of The '10-Year-Old Virgin. "My 
wedding time was quite fraught," admits Murphy, who first drew 
attention in the United States playing the lead in Danny Boyle's tensely clever 
horror flick 28 Days Later. All that manscaping was done to embody Kitten, the 
Irish transvestite with a wispy voice but steely resolve to find the mother who 
abandoned him in Neil Jordan's new film Breakfast on Pluto. 
Murphy is already bored by questions about his method of acting, the rigors of ~

at, you're that clever because you have to be." 
high heels, or even the implication that 
women spend more time in front of the 
mirror than men. "The thing is," says Mur­
phy, "men have the same products; they 
just have a different name. They call it 
scrub instead of exfoliator." 
Audiences certainly aren't bored by 
Murphy. His striking blue eyes and in­
triguing on-screen presence have turned 
the Irish actor into one of the hottest tal­
ents in the United Kingdom. Though he's 
never taken an acting class in his life, 
Murphy landed the first role he ever audi­
tioned for-in an acclaimed play called 
Disco Pigs-and set aside dreams of play­
ing rock and roll for a career that has in­
cluded Cold Mountain and two big hits 
this summer-the blockbuster Batman Be­
gins and the Wes Craven thriller Red Eye. 
Based on the Booker-nomina ted novel 
by Patrick McCabe (whose The Butcher 
Boy also became a Jordan film), Breakfast 
on Pluto follows a determined drag queen 
dismissive of the political turmoil and vio­
lence engulfing the small town he grows 
up in during the '70&-"Serious, serious, 
serious. There's that word again," says 
Kitten-but enraptured by the treacly pop 
songs that promise love and affection. 
When Kitten isn't searching for his 
mother, he stumbles into one strange 
world after another, performing as a 
75 -Cillian Murphy 
"squaw" in a glam-rock band led by Gavin 
Friday, tricking with a creepy Bryan Ferry 
(never trust a man who praises the song 
''Feelings "), dancing with a British soldier 
back from Ireland, and working as an 
assistant to magician Stephen Rea. 
Murphy's a huge fan of music-most of 
his friends are musicians-and he gets 
more jazzed meeting artists like Stevie 
Wonder than meeting movie stars. And 
he's always writing songs; Murphy was 
thrilled to record songs in the studio with 
Friday and to be involved in a movie 
soaked in vintage pop tunes. He also ab­
sorbed the world ofLmdon transvestites 
by going clubbing with a group of them. 
"It became clear to me how transves­
tites would develop that quick wit," says 
the 29-year-old actor. ''You get shouted at 
on the fucking street all the time. How the 
fuck are you that clever that quickly? 
Because you have to be." 
He adds, "Kitten is so fundamentally 
good. All she's looking for is to be loved and 
accepted. When I was out with those pe0-
ple, I found they didn't want to change the 
world; they just wanted to look pretty. It's 
that simple." •
