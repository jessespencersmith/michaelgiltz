STICI{/FINGERS
I dentitv theft is a voguish crime. But college stu-
I dents have been masters of it for years. They
I soak up the personalities of their favorite teach-
I ".r und fellow students with unembarrassed de-
light. One weekthey're anarchists; the next, Ro-
manticpoets.' College is the central location for the unsettling,
unsatisfying new novel by Charles Baxter ('The
Feast of Love")- Nathaniel Mason is torn between
two women: Theresa is an insecure small-town girl
who cloaks herself in intellectual irony; Jarnie is a
lesbian whq Nathaniel cajoles
into loving him.
Hovering is the would-be
mysterious character Jerome
Cootberg, who delights in
bante4 wordplay and taunts
- never mind if it doesn't
make any sense; at least he's
saying something.
Nathaniel believes Cool*
berg is stealing his identitY
by appropriatinghis life sto-
ry and frlching every item of
clothing and fumiture from
his apartrnent, piece by Piece'
Is Coolberg a demon suck-
ing up Nathaniel's soul? Or is
he just a fellow student with a
crush? "The SoulThief" threatens to be darker and
strangerthan itultimately turns out to be-
The final twist to the tale is anticlimactic' Yes,
writers are the most unrepentant soul thieves of
all. They lift details from the lives of others with
light-fuigered ease, But when the story is well-told'
no one notices or cares. It's only when the theft is
clumsy and the story misshapen that people can
'spot the crime. In this case, Baxter has been caught
red-handed. Michael Giltz</p>
