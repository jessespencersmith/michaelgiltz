10/17/2004 01:24:00 AMYep, the first inklings of mistreatment of prisoners at GuantanamoBay in Cuba are surfacing. Ultimately, just as problematic for themilitary and Bush people involved will be the lies to cover it up."Many detainees at Guantánamo Bay were regularly subjected toharsh and coercive treatment, several people who worked in theprison said in recent interviews, despite longstanding assertions bymilitary officials that such treatment had not occurred except in someisolated cases," writes the NYT.And they'll pay because they didn't just lie to the media, they lied toCongress and Congress don't like that."In guided tours of Guantánamo provided to the news media andmembers of Congress, the military authorities contended that thesystem of rewards and punishments affected only issues like whetherthe inmates could be deprived of books, blankets and toilet articles.The interrogation sessions themselves, the officials consistently said,did not employ any harsh treatment but were devised only to build atrusting relationship between the interrogator and the detainee."Obviously they don't know much about building trust.
