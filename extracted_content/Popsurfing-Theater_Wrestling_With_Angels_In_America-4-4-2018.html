THEATER: WRESTLING WITH "ANGELS IN
AMERICA"
ANGELS  IN  AMERICA  ** 1/2 out of ****
NEIL  SIMON  THEATRE
Is Angels  In  America  a great play? The question is almost absurd. It's
clearly a landmark work of theater. It's unquestionably a good  play. If
you traveled back in time and asked me the same question when I
exited the theater after seeing Part 1 on Broadway in 1993 I would
have laughed: the entire production and certainly the exhilaration of
Part 1 remains one of the most thrilling nights of theater in my life. Noone questioned the play's greatness; that wasn't allowed. I just knewthat decades from now, this show would be revived and performedagain and again. Indeed, here we are on Broadway 25 years later. I've
no doubt it will be back in 2043.
And yet, after two problematic revivals (the fine Signature revival Off
Broadway and this more problem-plagued revival on Broadway), I amstarting to wonder. It's a pity I didn't get to see the Ivo Van Hove
production at BAM. But I'm left with what I have seen and I'm
worrying over whether a play that looms so large in my imaginationhas stood the test of time. Maybe it's a simple case of nothing beingable to match my memory.
If you saw Marlon Brando directed by Elia Kazan in the Broadway
debut of A  Streetcar  Named  Desire,  could any subsequent production
do anything but pale in comparison? The impact of 
Angels  In  America
in that brilliant original version helmed by George C. Wolfe and let bya peerless cast ranks right up there. (And dear god, was that stageteeming with characters really performed by just eight people?)
On the other hand, a great play should reveal new facets, new depths
with a good revival. Every time I see an August Wilson play, I becomeever more convinced of his towering achievement. The same has not
happened with Angels  in  America. MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>For the moment, I'm going to blame the productions, not the play. The
big sweeping moments -- the undeniable ambition and desire of
playwright Tony Kushner to sweep up history and communism andreligion and family and sexuality and the plague of AIDS and decadesof American history and so much more in his all-encompassing work --feels less crucial now. Not dated, just not as involving. Today, it's the
human moments and not the spectacle, the sympathy and not the
didactic speeches that touch me. "It's not you, it's me," I want to say,though usually when we say this we're being polite and it's really you.
Ok, enough with the nonsense, the dithering. Here is the good news.The theater is packed, the audience is notably young for Broadway anda punch line about President Reagan doesn't just get laughs, it gets
applause. Simply seeing Angels  In  America  in that atmosphere is fun -
- if you've never seen it before, by all means do what you can to see
this before it's gone. Certainly my strong reservations about thisparticular production and more modest concerns about the play ingeneral are by far the minority (if not a minority of one).
Denise Gough has improved since London (maybe after nailing down
her American accent enough to focus on her performance?), JamesMcArdle takes the undeniably tricky role of Louis Ironson (the manwho abandons his lover when AIDS rears its ugly head) and pulls it off,

<p>Roy Cohn, Susan Brown is a little soft as Hannah Pitt but redeems
herself as Ethel Rosenberg and Nathan Stewart-Jarrett finds a subtler
angle on the nurse Belize. I don't think anyone will ever pull off theodd mannered speech of the Angels ("I...I...I...I...I really don't") but
Amanda Lawrence creates a distinctive spin on the part. The other
Nathan -- Nathan Lane -- I assumed would be chewing up the scenerya la Ron Leibman. But he's too good an actor for that: Lane finds aquieter, more human Roy Cohn, still funny and still ferocious but less
of a broad brush-stroke villain. It's terrific work (of course) and you
should see this Angels  In  America  for Nathan Lane's performance
alone, but that's true of Nathan Lane in almost anything ever.
Here is the bad news: Andrew Garfield as Prior Walter. He's a very
good actor I've admired on stage and screen. Here Garfield makes a
conscious choice about how to play the central role of the piece and forme it just doesn't work. I adamantly do not believe only gay actorsshould play gay roles, but I can't think of a better way to describe whathe's doing than to say Garfield is playing gay while Stephen Spinella in
the original production simply was gay. Oh he wasn't playing himself
or just being gay. Spinella was playing a specific character and thatcharacter both toyed with and subverted and celebrated gaystereotypes in a high-wire act that took your breath away.
Garfield lacks nuance and melody by starting each scene emotionally
at 11 and then turning it up higher. He's made a bold choice and sticks
grimly to it throughout the night; it's just the wrong choice. I'd saymuch the same about numerous other passages in a show directed byMarianne Elliott. Some of the fights between Joe and Harper Pitt orJoe and Louis or Harper and Joe's mother and most anything with
Prior Walter -- it plays at one pitch and one pitch alone and it's a very
high pitch. Rarely have I wanted to give notes to so many actors tomodulate, to find some quiet place and build a scene rather than beginat the peak. Only Nathan Lane in a role that was famously broad and
big and huuuuge from start to finish crafts his scenes with care so they
can actually go somewhere.
Other more fundamental problems exist. The scenic design by Ian
MacNeil -- especially in Part 1 -- is simply disastrous. Three different
revolving sets appear on stage in a row, vaguely indicating settings like
hospital room or office or home. The problem is that they are ugly,utilitarian and hard to tell apart. When one set revolves to indicate weare now outside that setting, you can barely tell the difference. Theydominate the entire first half until with a flourish we get a hint ofmore elaborate sets to come in part two. Those are more open, more
theatrical (a hospital room might include a bed and some neon lights
to indicate the walls surrounding it) but they're unprepossessing ontheir own. The contrast between part one and two offers no particularreward visually. The sense of the stage opening up is modest and
amounts to very little when all is said and done. And the music by
Adrian Sutton is so jarring, so intrusive and grandly self-importantthat it feels like a joke. After hearing it for two nights I am astonished</p>
<p>they didn't just remove it entirely. (Sutton has done excellent work on
War  Horse  and The  Curious  Incident...  and other shows. I can only
assume he was giving Elliott precisely what she wanted.)
The Angel is augmented with puppeteers for her movement and wings
-- I do love puppetry so while this gambit isn't a problem as such, I
wish I liked it more. More positively, the Angel Shadows are the castmembers clad in a mottled sort of costume who serve as puppeteersand move pieces of the set on and off the stage. They scuttle on and
slither off in a creepy sort of way that adds an unsettling undercurrent
to Part Two that at least adds interest where so little else of Elliott'schoices do.
And yet...and yet. Every time I wanted to dismiss some aspect of the
play or its structure or the themes it ambitiously tackled, damned if I
wasn't drawn in again by a scene, a character, a splash of bitter humor.I sat there for eight hours and was never bored for a second. I wasprovoked or angered or moved or pricked or ready to argue, but I wasnever bored. That alone speaks to the achievement of Kushner.
Even after seeing it three times and reading the text, I can be surprised
by what's in it. The show has an admirable empathy for all itscharacters -- including the electric scene in which Roy Cohn dies andothers recite the Kaddish while stealing his bootleg supply of AZT. And
yet, I'd forgotten that every character is accounted for and embraced
by the end in one way or another...except the poor conflicted, oncecloseted Joe Pitt. Was there no room for him to find peace or at leastbe blessed in his confused journey towards self-discovery or self-destruction?
So I want to wrestle with Angels , just as Jacob wrestled with the
angel. I want to argue and talk back and applaud and kvetch. And just
when I think I've got the angel pinned down (ok, maybe this play isn'tdated so much as "of its time") then it slips out of my grasp and
surprises me again. Jacob had only one night while I needed two, but
even that doesn't seem enough for a work that still confounds andchallenges me. When 2043 rolls around, I'll be ready for a rematch.
