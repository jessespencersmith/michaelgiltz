Bloody Fun But Not Great
GAME OF THRONES FIRST SEASON  ($79.98 BluRay; HBO) -- Game Of Thrones  may be the
biggest roll of the dice in TV history. It's based on a series of novels that tell one long story...and they
haven't even all been written yet. In fact, if author George R.R. Martin continues at his new slow pace, theshow may have to go on hiatus for a number of years before the series can reach its finale. And that finalewill take seven seasons to satisfy fans. It's also one of the most expensive shows in TV history, telling astory laced with fantasy and set in a medieval era with all the lavishness of a feature film.

<p>and I look forward to future seasons. I just wish the first one were better. The story is one of intrigue,
based loosely on the War of the Roses. Numerous royal families are vying for power while a supernaturalthreat from the North slowly works its way towards the "civilized" world. You get backstabbing,scheming, incest, swordplay, lots and lots of nudity and a clutch of fine actors. The problems? Castingand costuming. No expense was spared but the costumes and makeup quite often fall far short. Hair,makeup, clothing -- they should all invisibly denote the power and prestige of the wearers (or the lack).Instead, too often the costumes look just like that: costumes. Jaime Lannister is meant to be the mosthandsome, dashing man in the world but his clothing often looks like a Members Only jacket and thehaircut and demeanor of actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau remind you of Malibu Ken, not Lancelot. Harry
Lloyd also falls quite short as the intended to be menacing Viserys Targaryen. With his bleached white
hair and petulant manner, he seems like Draco Malfoy's cousin, not a threat to the throne. These
weaknesses continue for other minor characters and illustrate an unusual feature of GoT . Except for
Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister, almost all the "bad" guys in the series are far less interesting than the
"good" guys. That's rarely the case for a genre piece like this where the villains often get the best lines
and the most dastardly deeds. In contrast, the Stark clan is well cast up and down the line, from Sean
Bean as the family head to Maisie Williams in the challenging role of Arya (with a special shout out to an
excellent Kit Harington as the bastard Jon Snow). TV rarely tackles fantasy and almost never does it well,
so that and the appeal of the books will keep me watching. Stronger tech work and some better casting
(luckily, lots of people die so the show always has a chance to inject fresher, stronger talent) could turn
GoT  from a guilty pleasure into a genuine one. P.S. Maybe it's the slowdown in DVD sales, but it's great
to see the cost to consumers for an entire season of a show like this come down in price, especially on
sale. Less than $40? That used to be a fantasy, but no more.
MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE  ($39.99 BluRay; FOX) -- This intriguing drama stars Elizabeth
Olsen as the wayward sister who shows up looking for a place to crash but unwilling to talk about where
she's been or what she's done. In flashbacks, we see her get slowly drawn into a cult led by John Hawkes(in another excellent performance). Then the phone calls and the mysterious strangers make clear thatthis cult doesn't let its members take off so easily. More quiet tale than thriller, the film isn't an out of thepark success but delivers on its quiet premise quite nicely.
HUGO  ($44.99; Paramount) -- I enjoyed the graphic/novel by Brian Selznick, which had the much more
evocative title The Invention Of Hugo Cabret.  Changing that to just Hugo  was the first sign this movie
wouldn't deliver. The second was hiring director Martin Scorsese, a man not known for gentle family fare.But it's not entirely his fault. The appeal of the book rested entirely on how the story was told: a clevercombination of images a la a graphic novel (sometimes dozens of pages would go by without any text atall, just pictures advancing the story) and text (at other times the images would stop and the text woulddominate a la a traditional novel). The story itself was rather flat and unimaginative, with very little

<p>action or change of any consequence: in essence, a kid hiding in a train station discovers the man
running a toy store used to be a film director. That's about it. To bump up the action, lame subplots are
introduced to the movie like a romance between two older characters and a bumbling cop given a greatly
expanded role and his own attraction to a flower girl. That's interspersed with all sorts of chases andfancy camerawork. The movie looks just as artificial on 2-D at home as it did in 3-D at the theaterthough it's a blessed relief not to have to wear those bulky glasses when the effects were so minimal.Heavy-handed touches (like mixing the sound of a film projector unspooling early on in the movie tosubliminally remind us of the pleasures of movies) can be found throughout. Dramatically static,cartoonishly acted, Hugo  is not one for the ages, though a number of critics enjoyed it far more than me.
Well, they're wrong.
PUSS IN BOOTS  ($39.99 BluRay; DreamWorks) -- I've never been a huge fan of the Shrek  films (my
favorite one is their made-for-tv Christmas special; the movies I find too enamored with random popculture references). But thank goodness they spun off Antonio Banderas's witty character Puss In Boots. Iwould not want to have sat through a movie about Eddie Murphy's Donkey. This movie breathed a littlecreative life into a very tired franchise. It wasn't the massive success of the Shrek  movies, but $535
million is probably enough to guarantee another adventure.
SUPER BOWL XLVI CHAMPIONS  ($34.93 BluRay; NFL/Vivendi) -- More. That's my sole comment
about this highlight DVD, which does a good job of recapping the entire season of Super Bowl champsthe New York Giants and (finally) includes the extras you'd expect like post-game ceremonies, media dayand the like. NFL Films really does excellent work in capturing unlikely and striking footage of gamesthat's superior to what you see in a live game and during most movies about football. BUt why justrecaps? This should be a 2 DVD set with one DVD including the entire Super Bowl game day hoopla(with commercials that aired as a bonus feature -- why not?). That should be the cheap option. But theyshould also offer a boxed set with every regular season game of the Giants plus the 2 DVD Super Bowlpackage as well. And for about $70. Max. Finally, why not have a release for the Patriots. Theheartbreaking story of the losers can make for compelling drama too. They've got the footage. Why not?This one-disc release is more complete than in past years but still feels skimpy compared to the goodies
lying in their vaults unused and unseen.HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES

<p>TALES FROM THE GOLDEN AGE  ($29.99; Zeitgeist) - Multi-director omnibuses -- with multiple
short films strung together around an over-arching theme -- are one of the least-loved ideas in movie
history and rarely worth the bother. But this one comes from Romania, one of the most innovative and
exciting sources of movies in the past few years. Overseen by Cristian Mungiu (director of the acclaimed
4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days ), this pulls together urban myths and legends that sprang up around the
final years of the brutal Ceausescu regime, a terrible era the government propaganda machine defiantly
dubbed "The Golden Age." Mungiu teams with other talented filmmakers to spin multiple, mordantly
funny tales. It's funny how suddenly a country can become a hotbed of filmmaking for no discernible
reason, but that's exactly what's happened in Romania, making even a project like this seem a tantalizingprospect. Yes, when it comes to cinema, Romania truly is in a Golden Age.
IMMORTALS  ($39.99 BluRay; FOX) -- Director Tarsem Singh has a remarkable ability to create
striking imagery and it's on full display in this 300 -ish epic tale of a Theseus (Henry Cavill), a young
villager handy with weapons who takes on the mad king (Mickey Rourke) threatening to destroy theworld. It looks amazing, if you just turn off your mind and glance at the screen in a daze. But story?Characters? Dramatic involvement in their fates? Tongue in cheek fun? Nope. Not on the menu. Butwhat you do find on the DVDs menu are tons of extras like an alternate beginning and two alternateendings, which should tell you something right there.</p>
<p>THE BRIEF COMPLETE COLLECTION  ($59.99; Acorn) 
MIDSOMER MURDERS SET 19  ($59.99 BluRay; Acorn) -- Alan Davies of the gently charming
Jonathan Creek  series paired with the team behind TV's Inspector Morse about a barrister with a messy
personal life (gambling debts, an affair with the wife of a politician, etc) and far more successful legal
one. Nothing groundbreaking, but Davies does have his appeal. Meanwhile, Midsomer Murders  -- the
long-running British cozy mystery series (that is, crimes set in a village setting that are gently humorous)
-- continues along wit no signs of stopping after its latest four installments, each one a self-containedmovie of about 100 minutes. Unlike most "cozys," the murders are rather brutal in nature at times, butthe general tone is still amiable if not quite Murder, She Wrote.
THE SKIN I LIVE IN  ($45.99 BluRay; Sony Pictures Classics) -- One of the most baroque plots in
director Pedro Almodovar's history (pulled from a not terribly interesting novel) is unfortunately treatedwith deadly dull seriousness. Almodovar long ago started making the movies he used to lovingly send upand this is a prime example, with Antonio Banderas as a plastic surgeon who has a mysterious butbeautiful woman trapped in his home. It's silly from the stilted beginning to the ludicrous finale, butunfortunately the movie doesn't realize how silly the story is and we never get to have any fun.</p>

BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD VOLUME 4  ($26.99 BluRay; Paramount) -- Do we need another James
Bond spoof? No, we do not, but Rowan Atkinson's non-Bean creation Johnny English is a lot more
popular overseas so he will return. Are Adam Sandler's fans unthinking automatons? No, they are notbecause even they handed him a rare commercial flop with this tepid comedy about an annoying sisterwho comes to visit. Did anyone want to see a remake of the dated-the-day-it-was-released movieFootloose? Do they did not. I know it's nominally based on a true story but I always felt this story wouldhave worked better set in the 1950s.Will I laugh at Beavis and Butt-head? No, I will not. Hey, I like SouthPark and even enjoyed Beavis and Butt-head Do America, probably because they played actual charactersand had an actual story of sorts. But their TV show I find relentlessly...well, I can't say stupid because
they would laugh at me and say "duh!' Dull? Yes, dull. No change but fans will enjoy these all new
episodes. I guess.

My only niggle with this review is the criticism of Harry Lloyd. The character isn't the actual threat to
the kingdom, Dany is.
04:40 PM on 03/08/2012
Viserys Targaryen is supposed to be a menace to no one but his younger sister. Harry Lloyd'sperformance was spot-on, IMO. Too bad he can't be recast as some other character.
03:00 PM on 03/08/2012
In regards to the shades of morality, we are expected to identify and find favour with the Starksrather than the Lannisters, however there lies the beauty of the books and hopefully the rest of theTV series. This is not your traditional fantasy stories, as the plot unravels, allegiances changes and
so does our impression of the characters. There is no right and wrong, just different families and
sides, all with their own set of heroes and villains, power and ambitions. 
After reading the books, I think Jamie Lannister is one of the most interesting characters present. At
first he appears to be nothing but the ‘bad guy’, but give the next season a chance and you’ll seehis character develop to something outside the traditional archetype. 
As for the costume, I have to disagree. It looks fantastic, both the costumes and the scenery. I can
only hope the second season lives up to the first.Recency   | Popularity

Game of Thrones and Homeland were the best new series in 2011, IMO. Looking forward to season
2 for both of these shows!

I completely agree with your interpretation of "Hugo." When I heard the title was being changed forthe film I thought it augured that it would be disappointing. I felt like one of the only people whodidn't find "Hugo" to be completely and thoroughly enchanting - I thought the story was boring (and Idon't use that word lightly - I don't think "boring" is a valid complaint for why a person doesn't like
something), which combined with acting I thought was unconvincing and flat. I didn't think it hit on
much emotional connection between the characters - for the first time, Scorsese made me not careabout the people he was filming. I thought it was over-praised and I'm glad you made me feel like Iwasn't the only one who thought that!

The actual childs book has been very popular for years. I have not seen the movie asyet....bought it and will watch it soon. Granddaughter (16) and her boyfriend saw it in thetheaters and enjoyed it.
11:06 AM on 03/08/2012
I was actually very impressed with the show GoT. After the season ended, I bought and read all ofthe series and was amazed at how closely the series followed the first book. I haven't enjoyed ashow this much since "The Sopranos".
As for the casting, I think they did a pretty good job. Jamie is a character who is evolving and he's
still got a long ways to go. The series had to walk a fine line to make us dislike him but still leaveroom for redemption. I think they've set that up well.
06:09 AM on 03/08/2012
Well, I will agree that Sean Bean's wig sucked. flyers

<p>He didn't, though. I actually agree -- I like the Stark actors better, too. But let's look to next year,
shall we?

"Harry Lloyd also falls quite short as the intended to be menacing Viserys Targaryen. With hisbleached white hair and petulant manner, he seems like Draco Malfoy's cousin, not a threat to thethrone"
This is entirely consistent with the book. Viserys is only a threat to the throne in his own mind.
07:48 AM on 03/08/2012
Was about to post the same thing ,not sure Mike has actually read the books.
11:07 AM on 03/08/2012
Exactly. Describing Viserys as "petulant" is EXACTLY the point of the character! He's
supposed to be smarmy and egotistical and deluded - and that is exactly how he isportrayed on camera. I thought it was dead-on and, to me, lacked no menace. I also
thought it was bizarre that he criticized the casting when the issues that he stated he had
problems with seemed to fall under the category of writing than having the wrong actor forthe role.
01:29 AM on 03/16/2012
As I mentioned in my review, I have indeed read all of the books. (I stoppedreading the Robert Jordan books as they got so complex because I wanted to waituntil they were all done so I could tackle them all at once.) Yes, Viserys is petulant
in the books. He's also compelling and viciously cruel to his sister. In the show, I
found him a cartoon; just one-dimensional. I'm always happy to believe an actorcould be better in other parts. But since I found about half the cast quite strongand they were in the same show with the same writers and directors involved, I feltit was more likely the blame lied with the individual actors.

The costumes, set decoration, photography and even the sound effects were above the quality wesee today in theatrical releases......................Jamie Lannister is meant to be a pretty boy, not adashing swash-buckler, and everyone i know who watched the series had exactly that impression.

<p>Yeah, I'll weigh in here too regarding Game of Thrones. The author is looking to make comparisons
with artistic creations he might think should be a yardstick by which to measure Martin's creation,and in so doing he has sold both the series and himself more than just a little short (with apologiesto Peter Dinklage). Casting a problem? Not on your life, buddy. There isn't a weak actor here. He
doesn't understand Jaime, Vyseris, etc., etc. Jaime is not never was intended to be and never will
be "Lancelot." Vyseris IS petty, immature and a megalomaniac, not a menace (except in his own
mind . . .) Costumes lacking? Only if you think this is supposed to be the musical of "Camelot." This
is gritty realism guy - people are dirty, greasy and not always prancing around in their finest. I guesshe wants them to look like they just stepped out the costume shop for a high school musical. Badguys less interesting then the good guys? This isn't the world of black and white, good and evil, but
all shades of grey in between - that ambiguity is what makes them so difficult to predict or judge
and oh so fascinating. Boy did you strike out on this one! This sets a new standard for fantasydrama that will be unequaled for quite a while. Sheesh. Wish I wasn't limited to 250 words . . .
01:10 AM on 03/08/2012
I've read the books and love all these characters. I agree there are many shades of greybut used the shorthand of good and evil. most I think identify more with the Stark familythan say Jamie Lanister who has sex with his sister and tries to kill a little boy to cover histracks. Jamie does prove more nuanced later on in the books, but he's certainly no hero.
Viserys is more strightforwardly evil -- he tortures his sister and is petulant and obnoxious
as written. But as written he is also more interesting. I simply felt the actor's performance
was banal and simplistic. He too looked very "modern" somehow, a combination of
costume and hair and the like.
05:35 PM on 03/08/2012
Thanks for writing back - good discussion which you don't often get here with theregular writers (as opposed to the forum-posting community). I agree that Viserysis not as complex as in the books, but unfortunately I think that problem must be
laid at the doorstep of the writers and the limitations of a television series, even at
ten hours. Somewhere along the way, they were inevitably going to have to dosome serious trimming or the first season would have been 20 hours long. Ah, theglory of the novel with its potentially endless scope, publishers willing and all(although even there it's possible to go too far - I'm looking at your grave RobertJordan . . .) I don't think that Harry Lloyd did a bad job at all given that the writers
did indeed make the character more shallow than in the book. And perhaps I'm
allowing knowledge of things to come color my appraisal of Jaime who is indeedrather one-sided at the outset, although there must be that charm on some level orhe will be too evil to everyone else's shades of greys. More to come below . . .

As for costumes, I certainly didn't want pretty or fresh from the rack look. I felt the styleschosen -- such as jamie's jacket and many other outfits down the line -- didn't seemauthentic and of the same period as the rest of the show. I want gritty realism, not blow-dried hair. I had limited space too and in cutting down didn't make clear the nuances ofcharacter involved in the book and reflected most clearly in the first season's storyline for
Peter Dinklage. It is probably already the best fantasy (as opposed to sci-fi) series TV ever
did, certainly more ambitious by a mile than Xena. TV almost never does fantasy. But I feelit could be so much better and doesn't come within a mile of the books. Thanks forcommenting and giving me a chance to clarify my opinion.

<p>fantastic job bringing my beloved books to the screen and the casting could not be better. You

01:25 AM on 03/08/2012
Glad you're enjoying the show. I think the women are generally much better than the men
and the most important and difficult casting -- the young Stark children -- are very good.HBO spared no expense -- my complaints are not financial but creative. I hope the showbuilds on the good elements of the series and gets even better. PS Love the "You know
nothing" reference. I can't wait to see that line in the series; it's a killer emotionally.
03:20 PM on 03/07/2012
Personally, as a huge fan of the GoT book series I couldn't disagree more with the premise of thisarticle. The first season was spectacular in execution and in its faithfulness to the books. Casting for
Tyrion Lanister couldn't be better. Jaime was always going to be a problem because he is too good
to be true and, of course, he is; but later events will humanize him. Littlefinger is just as creepy and
conniving as in the books, though a bit overacted. Viserys is supposed to be a weak, petty little boywho could never be king; setting the stage for Daenyris' ascension. The series, if it continues withits current high quality and execution will become a watershed for multi-book adaptation to thescreen; a yardstick by which all others will be measured and found wanting.

I think we all knew Peter Dinklage had to play Tyrion the moment we read the books -- itwas as inevitable as Clark Gable playing Rhett. You're right that Jamie becomes moreinteresting as the books go along. Hopefully the actor's performance will improve along with
his costuming. Thanks for commenting.
