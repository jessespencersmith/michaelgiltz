7/22/2005 06:00:00 PMJohn Roberts: Hi, I'd like to be President of the United States.American people: Wonderful! You seem like an intelligent andnice guy. What's your foreign policy?Roberts: Well, gee, I don't think that's appropriate to talkabout before I become President.America: Oh. Well, what's your domestic policy?Roberts: Again, I think you should just trust me. I'll do theright thing.America: Uh, well, how will you continue the war on terror? Doyou think our ports and and coastlines and borders are safeenough?Roberts: That's exactly the sort of issue I'll be tackling asPresident, so that's exactly the sort of issue I can't commenton. I can't predict the future you know, so don't ask me what Imight do somewhere down the road.America: Well, do you think Bush has done a good job handlingthe post-war occupation of Iraq?Roberts: I have no opinion on that. Just vote for me, can't you?America: What about abortion?Roberts: WOAHHHH!!!!! Now you're getting OBSTRUCTIONIST!I'm not gonna stand for that sort of questioning.(Roberts storms out and, strangely, gets voted Presidentanyway.)
