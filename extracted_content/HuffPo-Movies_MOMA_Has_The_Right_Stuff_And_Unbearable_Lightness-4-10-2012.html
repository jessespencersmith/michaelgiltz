 Amazing Inspiring Funny Scary Hot Crazy Important WeirdMovies: MOMA Has The Right Stuff
(And Unbearable Lightness )
Certain movies simply must be seen on the big screen.
When people say that, they're usually referring to aspectacle, a widescreen epic like Lawrence of Arabia  or
2001: A Space Odyssey. . That's certainly the case with
The Right Stuff , a terrific 1983 look at the U.S. space
race and the Mercury astronauts at the heart of it.Cutting edge special effects, brilliant acting, the desire tocapture America at a particular point in time -- The
Right Stuff  is a grand film that deserves the silver
screen.
But it's just as true for movies that are ambitious in their ideas. The Unbearable Lightness of Being  is the
other  masterpiece from director Philip Kaufman and both of them are being screened this week  at
MOMA, with Kaufman in attendance both Wednesday and Thursday night to introduce these two movies(along with Walter Murch at the Right Stuff screening, one of the team of editors that worked on that
film).
I love both these movies and yet I haven't seen them in many years. Why? No matter how big my TV may
be, no matter how good my BluRay player or DVD copy, these are films I want to experience in a
darkened theater with a live audience. It's been well over a decade and I can't wait to see them again.
Kaufman is no stranger to the big screen hits: he was an integral part of creating the story for Raiders Of
The Lost Ark . Indeed, coming on the heels of a western and his (unnecessary but acclaimed) remake of
Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, The Right Stuff  was hotly anticipated. Some even fretted that its
straight arrow presentation of astronaut John Glenn might give him an unfair advantage in the upcoming
Presidential elections. (No dice. Ronald Reagan knew how to play the President better than Glenn everwould.) Despite rave reviews and a clutch of Oscar nominations, The Right Stuff  performed modestly at
the box office, failing to even match its budget.
The trailer doesn't help: its rah-rah sensibility is a far cry from the movie's nuanced, subtle and complex
take on these men and their mission.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>That makes it all the more remarkable that Kaufman was given such a free rein with his next movie. The
Unbearable Lightness of Being  is a remarkably intelligent film that showcased three powerhouse new
talents: Juliette Binoche, Lena Olin and of course Daniel Day-Lewis hot off his one-two punch of MyBeautiful Laundrette  and A Room With A View.  I hope someone asks Kaufman how he was ever able to
get the green light to make this sexy, adult, philosophical tale about young lovers caught up in the Czechspring for a U.S. studio. The trailer offers the promise of what every foreign film used to embody for
cineastes trapped in puritanical America: sex!
Of course, they came for the sex and they stayed for the philosophy. Both films are based on books. The
Right Stuff  is based on Tom Wolfe's famed nonfiction work and Unbearable  on Milan Kundera's
"unfilmable" masterpiece. I've seen the movie and read Kundera's book and still  can't fathom how anyone
would ever even attempt to turn that work into a movie. And yet somehow Kaufman did it and managedto capture the playful, essence of the work. It is wholly faithful to the spirit of the novel by being whollytrue to its own needs. Neither author was happy with the films made from their books, which may
explain why they're authors and not filmmakers. See either film and you'll be sent right to the books
they're based on (not to mention the music of Leos Janacek after Unbearable ) and find very different,
rich works of art that inform the movies you've seen. And see the movies if at all possible on the big
screen, where their scope, their vision and above all their ideas demand to be aired.
If you're interested, here is my original review of The Unbearable Lightness of Being  back in college,
along with my inclusion of the film on my best of the year list and a passing nod to The Right Stuff . (It
made my 1988 list because art films took a long time to reach the rest of the country back in those days.)
Kaufman's next film is an HBO movie about the fiery relationship between Ernest Hemingway and
Martha Gellhorn, one of the best war correspondents there ever was. I can't wait to see it. On my TV.
