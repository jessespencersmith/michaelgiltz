Richard Thompson  tackles two rock cliches in one fell swoop with his current album and tour. When it
came time to record Dream Attic  for his new label Shout Factory,  Thompson said (like so many touring
musicians before him), "Hey, we sound great on the road and whenever we tour a new album the music
sounds better by the end of the tour than it did when we recorded it. So why not record the next albumlive? Work out the songs...on the road!" So, like Jackson Browne and Joe Jackson and too many to
mention, that's what he did. The result is Dream Attic,  which is neither a landmark work of his nor a flop
but simply a new album by Thompson, stronger this time melodically than lyrically.

<p>Now that the album is out,  Thompson moved on to the current craze: playing an album in its entirety.
(As Addison Steele points out below, this has been going on a long time. I just consider the current fad
for doing so a notable revival of that old habit. Has it ever been this prevalent though? Almost everyone
is doing it right now.) So his current show begins with all 13 songs from his new CD and then moves ontohis vast catalog of brilliant work. (And where oh where is the boxed set of Richard and Linda Thompson,remastered, with a bonus CD or two of live stuff and extras in a nice compact box once and for all?)
I wasn't gutted that my guest and I were late getting to Town Hall  (thanks, NYC subway system!) and
came in during the second song because the first -- "The Money Shuffle" -- is far and away the weakest
on the album, with tepid digs at the financial industry. Not surprisingly, the album's songs sounded
better live despite being road-tested by the band because the album's strength is its melody and they
could stretch out further in concert. In case you didn't know, Thompson is easily -- yes, easily -- thegreatest guitarist in history on both the acoustic and electric guitar. He's certainly right up there in either
category alone. Toss in the fact that he's a world-class songwriter and you've got a sense of his skill.
Tonight, it happened first on "Sidney Wells," a song in 9/8 time Thompson helpfully told us. A piercing,
driving number, the music built and built and built with Thompson tearing into a guitar solo that
virtually lifted the crowd off its feet. (I say virtually because we actually stayed seated so we wouldn't missa note before leaping and roaring our pleasure.) Thompson was deep into it when he slowly worked his
way back out again, finally looking up at his bandmates with a look of pleasure and setting them all off on
another fierce passage.
The world is filled with virtuosos, guys who can play the guitar in a fast and flashy manner. What is it
about Thompson's playing that elevates it so? First, of course, the solos are musically consistent -- theyfollow an internal logic (often a mathematical one that we instinctively respond to even if we couldn'tparse it). But Thompson's solos are never just about runs or showing off. They're also emotional
journeys. "Sidney Wells" is about a cold-hearted serial killer who boasts about what he's done when the
cops finally come calling. Thompson's solo is a cry from the heart, both a reflection of the violence, thetortured mind of Wells and the women he slaughtered. I'm bringing all that to the music, of course, but
the truth is that his solos aren't just impressive: they're moving.
Then show stepped into high gear when Thompson dug into his catalog of songs. "Time Will Show The
Wiser" kicked things off, a gem from the first Fairport Convention album. (They're the British equivalent
to the Band, but folkier.) Then he blew us away again with "You Can't Win," a more recent tune that's abit of a workout -- a song the band can stretch out on. Thompson did that again with another coruscating
solo that equaled the brilliance of "Sidney Wells."
Another showstopper was "Al Bowley's In Heaven." Once mostly an acoustic number, it was the tune that
stopped 'em dead every night, the way "1952 Vincent Black Lightning" does now (Thompson is resting
that classic for the moment). Now it's performed beautifully and then gives everyone a moment in thespotlight. This touring band also plays on the album and simply because of where I was seated, I wasfocusing on drummer Michael Jerome a lot. He's a striking figure behind the drum kit, towering over
them (quite a tall fellow) but playing with subtlety and skill and noticeable pleasure. The drum solo is one
of the more dreaded conventions in rock but he made it a delight.
"Wall of Death" -- from the masterpiece Shoot Out The Lights  -- was given a full-bodied treatment and
then they wrapped it up with the romp "Tear Stained Letter." For the encore, Richard returned to the
stage with his son Teddy, who has grown stronger and stronger with each one of his solo albums.  They
sang a duet on the Tim Finn of Crowded House gem "Persuasion." That's the very first number manypeople heard from Teddy, when he joined his dad onstage years ago. It's fascinating to see how much

moving, not to mention the pleasure they took in performing together. Here's video from a much earlier
performance, still quite lovely.
Two more numbers  and that was it. When you see an artist repeatedly, you're not seeing them in concert
so much as checking in. What songs are on their mind right now? Oh, "Man In Need," that's a terrific
one. "One Door Opens?" Oh and "Tear Stained Letter" still gets 'em moving. Thompson is such a wry,
friendly presence that his every utterance draws a chuckle from the faithful (most of the time a deservedone, though sometimes he'll say "thanks" and they'll still be in stitches).
His core audience returns again and again. You don't spend the show waiting for some epic solo -- every
song has passages of show-stopping brilliance from someone in the band. But you know that at somepoint, he'll stop your heart. Maybe it's a lyric that cuts home, maybe it's a strangled vocal or maybe it's
hearing an old favorite for the first time in years. But invariably it's also a musical solo that tears you
down and builds you up at the same time. You expect it. Heck, you demand it. But it still surprises andmoves you every time.

145 FansI've seen Richard Thompson solo 3 times and he is one of the greatest performers I've ever seen.
He plays the guitar like NO ONE else in the biz, imo. He is always up and in a great mood/energ y
and is such a humorous man as well.
I am a big Richard Thompson fan, but I must correct a factual error. Playing an album in its entirety
is not a new rock trend. In the early 1970s, it was commonplac e for bands that considered their
albums "concepts, " particular ly the prog-rock groups like Yes and Emerson, Lake & Palmer, to play
whatever album they were promoting all the way through and as much like the studio version thebetter. The effort usually resulted in a stage absolutely cluttered with instrument s so that, for
example, guitarist Steve Howe of Yes could play five or six different guitars in one song.
Thanks. I should have worded it better. It's certainly been done before but surely thepractice has never been this widespread ? It seems like EVERYONE is doing it, from major
acts to cool indie bands and not just prog-rock acts like Genesis and ELP. Thanks for thereminder. I've tweaked the comment in the story.
First, we saw RT in Wilmington DE a couple of nights before the NYC show. Thefirst set really did showcase the new record perfectly. 
Second, I am unsure of the year, but I saw Jethro Tull play several weeks before
the release of "Thick As A Brick" was released. Ian Anderson started off byannouncing that the band would play a "cut" from their forthcomin g LP. That took
about 45 minutes! Talk about opening a show with a complete album set! (If youdo not get the silly irony here, you are too young.)
I saw the show in DC last week. It will probably my show of the year. I'd seen Richard solo acouple of times but this was the first time with his band. He will be back in NY (solo) next March:

56 FansI first heard Richard back in '72; the album was First Light, with Linda. Still my favorite.
I am a mo ron!!!!!!!
Heard about the tickets going on sale two weeks beforehand , but didn't act until too late to get in.
So sorry I missed the show.So right about being the best acoustic guitar player as well. Have seen him many times on Long
Island in smaller venues where he could only play by himself, and he gets so much out of one guitarI almost want to see him by himself all the time.
Alas, sorry I missed the show and will be much more vigilant next time I have the opportunit y!!!
Thanks for the post, nice to hear first hand about it.
Go to his website and register your email. They sometimes release good seats at the last
minute to frustrate scalpers and fans get a heads-up.
Thanks for the suggestion , I'm going to do just that!!!
RT is a terrific guitarist, songwriter and performer. I've seen him many times and he always puts ona great show, whether it's him alone, or with a band. Dream Attic is a great follow-up to SweetWarrior, which was his best album lately, but they're all good. It's odd he doesn't play in LA muchsince he lives there.
He did an in-store at Amoeba in Sept.

<p>14 FansSeen the great Mr. Thompson many times and he always delivers. One of the best shows I ever
saw was his solo performanc e at McCabe's guitar shop in Santa Monica. Unfortunat ely he rarely
plays LA anymore. If there's a better combinatio n of songwriter /guitarist /singer in rock I haven't
heard it.
RT was at the Grammy Museum in March. Great venue.
