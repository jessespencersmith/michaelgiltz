<p>LILIAN BOXFISH TAKES A WALK by Kathleen Rooney
In “Lillian Boxfish Takes a Walk,” author Kathleen Rooney sets her delightful character on a reflective, 
autobiographical journey through the landmarks of her life in New York City. Once the highest paid woman copywriter in the country with her job at department store R.H. Macy in the 1930s, Lillian Boxfish had everything. When the novel opens, she is in her eighties and her knees don’t work so well anymore. It is New Year’s Eve, 1984 and during this evening’s walk she will barter with a mugger over her fur coat, attend a party in a rundown artist’s loft where she feels like an exhibit out of a wax museum and sit down to dine with a family of complete and rather boring strangers at Delmonico’s. Anyone who enjoys a wonderful story should also be happy to take a walk with Lillian Boxfish, one of the most delightful and witty characters to emerge in years.... Read More.

<p>HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS by Edward Jay Epstein
Edward Jay Epstein's new investigation of Edward Snowden is a useful corrective to the knee-jerk hero worship that the most famous whistleblower/traitor of modern times has inspired. By focusing on the timeline of what Snowden did when, Epstein strongly suggests that intentionally or not, the hacker-turned-activist handed over a wealth of intelligence info to Russia, an enemy of the US, and compromised its ability to track terrorists and other rogue groups, at least over the short term. At the very best, it's a sobering reminder of the risks even a well-intentioned whistle-blower is taking with the fate of nations when they seize access to literally millions of highly sensitive documents and take them overseas. On the other hand.... Read More.

HOLLYWOOD'S HOTTEST WRITER? RUDYARD KIPLING!"
The Oscar nominations will be announced on January 24 and at BookFilter, that's both a national holiday and 
a good reason for setting an alarm. (Hey, we read late into the night so we can find more great books for you!) One name sure to be celebrated is Rudyard Kipling. His Mowgli stories known collectively as "The Jungle Book" were adapted into a hugely popular Disney movie by "Iron Man" director Jon Favreau. In true Hollywood magic, this live-action movie features a young boy alongside talking animals in a realistic jungle setting...but it was all shot on a set in downtown Los Angeles. If the film isn't recognized in various tech categories, that outburst of dismay you hear will be from our headquarters. Naturally, a sequel is in the works,.Plus Andy Serkis (the actor who played Gollum) has a competing version due out in 2018 and there's even an adaptation of Kipling's poem "If" being prepped in Chile! If you've never read "The Jungle Book," here's a beautifully illustrated edition worth checking out.

<p>THE BELIEVER by Joakim Zander
Author Joakim Zander says he was a lawyer for the European Union in Brussels and Helsinki, but he sure has the resumé of a spy! Born in Sweden, he has lived in Israel and Syria, went to high school in the US and earned his law degree in the Netherlands. Ok, at the very least he sounds glamorous, a fact that didn't hurt sales of his debut thriller "The Swimmer." Now his stand-alone sequel (you don't have to have read the original) is earning similar critical acclaim and great buzz. Virtually every thriller writer around working at a certain level of intelligence gets the "next Le Carrè tag," which is about as useful as a singer-songwriter being called the next Dylan. But taken as a badge of honor that the writing is smart and a cut above, the reviews show that's an honor Zander has earned.... Read More.

MY LIFE, MY LOVE, MY LEGACY by Coretta Scott King
As so often happens, it wasn't until many years after Dr. King's assassination that the importance of Coretta Scott King began to be fully appreciated. An accomplished woman, she was at first the classic example of "behind every great man...." By founding the Martin Luther King Jr. Center For Non-Violent Social Change, protecting and extending his legacy to other struggles for freedom and speaking out in measured and passionate voice as a leader of the fight for civil rights to whom attention must be paid, Coretta Scott King showed the mettle of the person standing by his side for all those years. Towards the end of her life, King opened up to Dr. Barbara Reynolds and the result is this memoir "as told to" which can provide inspiration to people of faith, people of color and anyone wanting to share in an amazing story.....

<p>GALACTIC EMPIRES edited by Neil Clarke
Empires rise and empires fall and no genre loves their sweep and scale and (often) battered glory more than science fiction. Acclaimed editor Neil Clarke has brought together a collection of tales depicting empires of all types and at all stages in their history. For those who want their sci-fi on a grand scale or who need an example of how sci-fi isn't usually predicting the future but depicting the present. Authors include classic names like Robert Silverberg to current best-sellers Naomi Novik and Brandon Sanderson and some fresh new talent like Ann Leckie.... Read More.

THE DUMPLING GALAXY COOKBOOK by Helen You
The BookFilter headquarters features many take-out menus but no cookbooks -- we can barely be trusted to heat up left-overs. That's why we love giving cookbooks to our friends so THEY can prepare great dishes. 
"The Dumpling Galaxy Cookbook" is our new favorite, springing from a hole-in-the-wall shop in Flushing,</p>
<p>Queens to wide fame thanks to raves in the New York Times and elsewhere. Owner and chef Helen You walks  
you through every step of how to make dumplings and we're ready to sample them and clean up the dishes 
when you're done.... Read More.

***************WHEN IT COMES TO POLITICS, IT'S ALWAYS 1984
Author George Orwell was so insightful and smart that he is eagerly claimed by people on the left and the right. Orwell died on January 21, 1950 and whether you think he would have covered the inauguration on January 20, the marches on January 21 or both, you'll find something to savor in his work. One of Orwell's best is "Homage To Catalonia,"  a memoir about his experience reporting on the Spanish Civil War and then 
fighting against the Fascists. He's self-deprecating and somehow both passionately idealistic and bitterly pragmatic at the same time. That helps explain his lionization by both socialists and  National Review, which 
named "Homage To Catalonia"  one of the ten best nonfiction books of the century. (His collected essays are 
also in the Top Ten. How many have you read? )

THE FIRE BY NIGHT by Teresa MessineoSometimes the copy writers at a publishing house really know how to hook us: they call this debut by a Reading, Pennsylvania novelist a "Band Of Brothers" for nurses and that and a clutch of early strong reviews by critics and readers has us eager to dive in. "The Fire By Night" spans from Hawaii to France to Manila, from
 
before Pearl Harbor to after the war ends, all while staying focused on the friendship of two women that can't be broken by war or being a world apart from each other. I mean, we could wait for the movie or miniseries, but why? You know the book is always better.... Read More.

BEAST by Doug Merlino
Sometimes a book slips past us in hardcover and we discover it in paperback. That's the case with this real-life look at four men looking to become champions in the brutal and hugely popular world of mixed martial arts. Author Doug Merlino embedded with four people ranging from a Bosnian refugee to a middle-aged fighter enjoying a burst of celebrity to a one-time Olympic wrestler, all of them training in the same Florida gymand struggling to make it as a professional athlete. But only one of them will fight their way to a championship bout.... Read More.
