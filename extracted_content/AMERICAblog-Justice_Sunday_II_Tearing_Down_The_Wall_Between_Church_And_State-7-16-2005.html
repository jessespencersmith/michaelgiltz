7/16/2005 03:20:00 PMThe far right created such controversy with its melding ofpolitics and religion with (In)Justice Sunday that they're doingit again. Justice Sunday II is set for August 14 -- break outyour Bibles and your ballots, people! This time, however, theymay play it a little smarter and not invite the politicians. As fortheir agenda? To put all hot-button social issues off the tablewhen it comes to Supreme Court nominees."...the new telecast would again say that questions posedby Democrats about a nominee's personal beliefs onabortion and other issues would amount to anunconstitutional "religious test," wrote the New York Times.Uh, people, those are called "legal" issues, not religious ones. Isuppose they'd object to finding out if a Supreme Court nomineeopposed desegregation too, since that's a "religious" belief as well.Their lineup sure is impressive:Scheduled speakers in the telecast include James C.Dobson, the influential founder of Focus on the Family;former Senator Zell Miller, Democrat of Georgia; Charles W.Colson, the former Watergate figure and the founder of anevangelical group, Prison Fellowship; the veteran Christianconservative organizer Phyllis Schlafly; and WilliamDonohue, president of the Catholic League for Religious andCivil Rights. Mr. Perkins said the organizers planned toinclude a Jewish speaker as well.By my count, that makes it one leader of a nasty fringe group, onenutty politico, a criminal who betrayed his country's trust in one ofour greatest scandals and went to jail for it, a woman who opposeswomen's rights and a fringe Catholic who makes Mel Gibson seemreasonable. And a Jew. I am so there.
