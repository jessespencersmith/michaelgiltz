lR& 1Nclpt comedies and adventutee 
power Hollywood's most profitable season. 
Well on their way to another record-setting 
year, the major studios are looking forward to 
• bumper crop of highly anticipated movies. 
Highly anticipated, perhaps, because they're 
so darn familiar; among the other sequels 
vying for your attention are Ghostbusters II, The 
1<Jlrm Kid Ill, Sta.r Trek V; The FifUll Frontier and 
that eequelln the making, Batman. 
We're not even done yet. Lethal Weapon n 
and License to Kill, the 16th (!) James Bond 
movie, will also be pushing their way into 
North America's 23,000 theaters. 
CONTINU ED 
P~CB SIX</p>
<p>They'll be joined by Pink Clldillac, a 
Clint Eastwood action-comedy with 
Bernadett e Peters; Turner & Hooch, a cop 
and his dog comedy starring Tom 
Hanks; and The Abyss, an underwater 
epic directed by James Cameron, the 
man behind The Terminator and Aliens. 
Hollywood even threw in a few dra­
mas for variety. Peter Weir, who helmed 
Witness and The Mosquito Coast, is at the 
head of Dead Poets Society, a drama 
about an unconventional teacher in an 
all-male boarding school. It's the first 
film for Robin Williams since his break­
tJuoough into movie-stardom with Good 
Morning, Vietnam. Also look for Great 
Balls of Fire, the story of rocker Jerry Lee 
Lewis that re-teams The Big Easy's duo 
d .. ctor O'ennis Quaid and director Jim 
McBride . 
TvJo real wild cards are Young Ein­
stein, an Austrjllia n comedy written, di­
rected an.t"Starring someone named 
Yahoo Serious -who deserves to be 
famous for that reason alone -and Erik 
The Viking, a "comedy with a con­
science" from Monty Python veteran 
«ry Jones. 
Naturally, not all of these movies can 
be hits. But with so many films that have 
a built-in audience, at least three and 
ssibl 
er 
to five movies will gross over $50 mil­
lion. 
Five or ten years ago, this was un­
thinkable. After the unconvention al suc­
cess of Jaws convinced studios to go for 
a wide release on opening weekend 
0000 or more screens), summer became 
itated by two or three flicks that 
ade all the dough. If nothing broke 
out, a ha~dful of movies would bounce Now they have the best of both 
worlds. The last few summers have seen 
two or three blockbusters and a group 
of respectable hits massed below them. 
This across-the-board success of such a 
wide range of movies may be one of the 
best indicators of how strong 
Hollywood's current boom times are. 
To help you wade through all of those 
Roman numerals, APPLAUSE has 
combed such industry publications as 
Variety and Hollywood Reporter to get the 
latest buzz on the movies they expect 
you to see. Below we've made predic­
tions as to which pix will click and why, 
as well as fingering the ones we think 
(or hope) won't do as well as expected . 
THE BIG BOYS 
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade -
the last two entries in this saga are 
among the top 10 grossing movies of all 
tiPle and this might very well join them 
there. Spielberg finds it very difficult to 
make an unenjoyable movie; and when 
the subject at hand isn't wife abuse and 
poverty, that isn't a problem. Throw in 
the cross-generational appeal of Sean 
Connery and River Phoenix and there 
isn't a soul in the world who won't want 
summer. has a 1I~~tr:~:~~~I~;; ~!-1~~~miiti"irrm~ ~~t~e, this boasts headed by Ed Harris, and director James Joker and 
Cameron pulled out all the stops -and the visual flair of Tim Burton, who di­
budget restraints -for this underwater rected Beetlejui ce and Pee Wee's Big Ad­
extravaganza. People have spent the last ventKre. Michael Keaton seemed an odd, 
two years talking about the box office even goofy, choice for the superhero, 
poison of baseball movies, but we can't but by all accounts he's done it. This is 
even think of a well-made, popular also the only big flick to have a strong 
movie set under the ocean. Well, we can music tie-in - a new album by Prince, 
now. inc:h&ciing the first single, "Batdanee." 
Batman -inspired by the revisionist Only its dark and violent nature will

summers to come.

million, but even a solid comedy wttt StaT Trek V; The Final Frontier -this primed to carry a role where he doesn't 
suffer in comparison to the original, the is a rare instance where the sequels have resort to his stand-up routine. While 
top-grossing comedy of all time and a continued to grow in popularity. Star quite serious, it looks to be much more 
true gem. Certainly neither Murray nor Trek IV was the top-grossing entry so uplifting than Weir's The Mosquito Coast.

as The Joker in Batman. Shatner will probably be little more than 
competent. Here's hoping they don't try 
to Ilk ."y ore sequels out of a re­
spectable string of flicks. 
License to Kill-remarkably, while the 
James Bond series is the most lucrative 
one ever, no individual movie has yet 
to break the $100 million barrier. Timo­
thy Dalton has added a much welcome 
harder edge to the character of Bond 
that will keep it alive for another string 
of hits. But unless the producers finally 
drop such predictables as a car with 
fancy gadgets and vapid, female side­
kicks, thi80wm .remain a sturdy but un­

Turner & Hool-.. '.-.nis cop and his dog 
movie promises to be the second Tom 
Hanks flick to be the best of a slew of 
similar-minded fare. It will follow the 
insipid Jim Belushi vehicle, ~-9, as well 
as a cable television series called Rin Tin 
Tin: K-9 Patrol. What possesses these 
people to jump on such an unexciting 
premise? Are they that desperate for 
ideas? 
Young Einstein -only E.T. and Croc­
odile Dundee have earned more money 
in this movie's native Australia, where 
writer / director / star Yahoo Serious is a 
full-fledged celebrity. He is genuinely 
odd and promises to generate plenty of 
publicity for this off-beat hit. Could eas­
ily grow much, much bigger. 
Dead Poets Society -the industry buzz DOGS 
The Karate Kid III -the sequel made 
more money than the original, God help 
us all, but it won't happen again. The 
formula was predictable but enjoyable 
the first time around. Now it will be 
extremely tiresome. Of course, failure at 
the box office is a relative term. If Kid 
III grosses less than $50 million, it's a 
bust. 
Lethal Weapon II -it's probably just 
wishful thinking to hope this doesn't do 
as well as its inexplicably popular pre­
decessor . Yes, Mel Gibson and Danny 
Glover had a nice chemistry. But the 
movie looked cheap and director Rich­
ard Donner did a sloppy job. Ce>nsider­
ing the trailer for this one involved toilet 
humor, it's doubtful things have im­
proved much. They're expecting a 
blockbu ster, but this should stall 
around $50 million. 
Pink Cadillac -Clint Eastwood is 
showing his age and this story of a 
bounty hunter looks mighty familiar. 
. Bernadette Peters should spice things 
up considerably , yet it won't be enough. 
The regular fans will come and precious 
few others. They'll be in line to see 
Indiana Jones again. 
Honey, I Shrunk The Kids -this de­
pressing entry looks like it came from 
the same Disney that made Herbie the 
thfog-6fJeS UJ Monte Carlo, the same 
Disney that thought good family enter­
tainment had to be witless and dumb.</p>
