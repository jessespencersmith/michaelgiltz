 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: "Milk Like Sugar" Is Sweet;

MILK LIKE SUGAR  *** out of ****
PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZON
Milk Like Sugar  is a familiar tale of young people
struggling to break free from a cycle of poverty and
hopelessness. But distinctive and funny dialogue, smart
direction and an excellent cast can enliven any story.
Kirsten Greenidge's play begins with a bang as three
high school girls strut onto the stage with all the attitude
and self-possession of pop stars. It's the birthday of Annie (Angela Lewis) and they're waiting outside a
tattoo parlor, with Talisha (a very funny and focused Cherise Boothe) and Margie (a wittily dopey Nikiya
Mathis) bantering over what sort of design Annie should get.
Margie is pregnant but rather than worrying about the stress and responsibility as a single mom, she's
rhapsodizing over cool baby carriages, dope baby clothes and the like. Talisha -- who insists everyone
start calling her "T" because she's so cool she doesn't even need her full name -- decides to join Margie inmotherhood (it'll be fun!) and Annie is reluctantly dragged along into this baby mama pact. The dialogue
is so funny and precise -- with Margie consistently judging every potential male by the status of his cell
phone -- that this sad spectacle is convincing, hilarious and sad all at once. Milk Like Sugar  is good, but

<p>it's never as good as it is in this first scene.
Slowly we're drawn into Annie's dilemma. She has a hardworking mother (a fierce Tonya Pinkins) who
finds solace in filling a notebook with stories, so we know Annie can dream bigger dreams. But her
shelves are filled with milk like sugar -- powdered milk instead of the real thing -- and to keep her friends
she needs to keep her word. Will she do it with Malik (J. Mallory-McCree), the smart and polite senior
who wants to go to college and loves looking up at the stars? Will it be with the sexy tattoo artist
Antwoine (LeRoy McClain) who seems to have it all together? Or will Annie find religion via the awkward
and earnest fellow student Keera (Adrienne C. Moore)?
Milk Like Sugar  becomes less distinctive the further away it moves from that sharp-tongued almost
satirical opening. But the talent on display is too good to ever let your attention wander. Lewis is nicely
tentative as she struggles to express the confusion and desires in her heart. Mallory-McCree has the mostthankless role as the do-gooder Malik; despite a modest edge to his passion, Malik is merely an idea ofescape. McClain on the other hand makes Antwoine fully realized and not so dangerous as you might
expect.
Pinkins nails her scenes with authority though Annie has so much stacked against her it feels like
cheating when Annie's mom switches from beaten-down to mean. In the same way, the show builds to a
rousing climax where the walls -- a distinctive element in Mimi Lien's strong but spare set design -- areliterally closing in on her. But then the show retreats to a softer epilogue where the fates of all thecharacters are spelled out and we're given two or three reasons to hope for the best. Toni-Leslie James
had a blast with the costumes, the sound design and original music by Andre Pluess is terrifically good,
and the lighting by Justin Townsend keys the changing emotions with ease.
Above all, director Rebecca Taichman mines the material for all its worth. The scene changes in particular
show her inventiveness and focus. Chairs and other props are moved on and off by characters butTaichman uses those silent moments to have different actors react and play off of each other in
meaningful, telling ways. All the talent raised their game and gave the words of Greenidge the best
possible showcase.
LOVE'S LABOR'S LOST  ** 1/2
THE PUBLIC THEATER
The Public Lab is one of the best bargains in town with $15 tickets to new plays and classics given an
enthusiastic airing by fresh talent. This production of Love's Labor's Lost is a good example: it's a pretty
good retelling of Shakespeare's romance with enough good performers on display to make you forgiveany inconsistencies or ideas that don't quite pan out.
Karin Coonrod has certainly staged this play with energy: the actors are literally running around the
entire theater, acting on the stairs, the walkways behind the audience and occasionally even on the stage
itself, which is a modest affair with a patch of green in the middle and little else. The King Oof Navarre (a
fine Hoon Lee) wants to devote himself to study and convinces three friends to take a pledge and avoideven the sight of women, much less any pleasure, while doing so. Berowne (an excellent Nick Westrate) isMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>the only one to speak out against such lunacy but he's soon cajoled into going along.
Needless to say, a delegation from France soon arrives with beautiful women galore and each and every
man falls in love with a woman from the Princess Of France (a good Renee Elise Goldsberry) to Rosaline
(Rebecca Brooksher, who matches Westrate in wit and charm) on down the line.
On the side we have the clowns with their own lovelorn tales of woe. As I often find, the clowns are most
enjoyable when played least dumb. Reg E. Cathey (of The Wire ) has some silly pratting about but when
allowed to speak from the heart with seriousness he is quite strong. Similarly, Robert Stanton is mosteffective in his dual roles when least foolish.
The clowning is not the show's strong part and certain ideas are raised and then dropped. A Puck-like
page (Samira Wiley) can stop the action of the show and cause mischief, but this is merely revealed in the
beginning and then randomly used to no effect throughout. The scene in which the clowns perform a play
for the nobility is turned quite nicely into something dark: as the fools are mercilessly mocked by the
men, their prospective mates see these mean moments as petty and seem to turn on the men. But this
emotion leads nowhere.
Still with two leads who shine, Love's Labor's Lost is buoyed by their pleasure: Westrate holds the stage
with ease time and time again, while Brooksher gives him a prize worth the winning. Francis Jue is good
in his smaller role of the curate Sir Nathaniel and Stephanie Dimaggio makes positively the most
imaginable out of the tiny role of Jaquenetta. A grunt here, a puzzled question there and she's created a
wholly memorable character that never wavers. Love's Labor's Lost  has a consistent buoyancy but it's not
quite as strong-willed as Jaquenetta. Still with Westrate and Brooksher front and center, it never feelslike work.
THE ATMOSPHERE OF MEMORY  1/2 *
BANK STREET THEATERPlaywright David Bar Katz's new work is an exhausting story about a playwright who has written a family
drama based on his own painful childhood. He casts his actor girlfriend as his sister and then casts hismother (a retired actress played by Ellen Burstyn) as his mother and when his ne'er do well father (John
Glover) steamrolls into town, yelling and arguing and hashing out of old memories ensues. None of it is
interesting.
The play is filled with so many inconsistencies and confusions that they're too numerous to mention. To
focus on one key moment, the playwright (Max Casella) spent his childhood tape recording every family
conversation and transcribing them into notebooks. They fill literally dozens of black school composition
books with key moments from his parents endless bickering. He takes one of those notebooks andconfronts his father with the moment when dad meanly told his son he was going to leave for good unless
the kid could give him some reason to stay. This is meant to force Glover to face up to his meanness and
cruelty. The only problem? Glover's dad relishes his meanness and cruelty. He doesn't need to be forcedto admit it -- he loudly proclaims it every minute. He insults and demeans everyone around him everyminute of every day and gleefully acknowledges it. So what possible cathartic moment could the son be
hoping for? His dad KNOWS he's a prick; it's in fact his defining characteristic. He would be upset if you
didn't think he was a prick. So this hoped for powerful moment has zero impact since it doesn't revealanything the dad and we don't already know.
Glover leads with his crotch in this show (if you saw his performance, you'd know what I mean) and in
some inexplicable way manages to create a genuine character. It helps that he has the meanest, mostvivid bits of dialogue. In the fuzzier role of the mother who is both less and more than she seems,
Burstyn like everyone else struggles and fails to make sense of the show -- and the even worse show
within a show that we catch glimpses of. Melissa Ross somehow gins up some emotion as the sister,which is a small miracle. But these are small passing moments of interest and not nearly enough to
rescue the work.
All the tech elements are out of kilter because they are desperate to do something with a floundering
work. Adam Schlesinger of the marvelous Fountains Of Wayne devises desperate cues in his score that
can't create drama where none exists. The set feels random and director Pam McKinnon (soon to be seenon Broadway with an acclaimed revival of Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf) is at a loss. A couch is themain bit of furniture and it's rotated this way and that with sometimes the actors standing in front of it
and sometimes behind it and sometimes even to the side of it to no effect.
One scene brings the show to life. For whatever reason, the play and the play within the play are utterlyTOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 9

<p>unconvincing but the notebooks -- the bits of dialogue from the playwright's childhood -- are far more
interesting and focused and real than anything else in the show. When the family sits down and reads outloud a scene from the past -- a scene in which the daughter is humiliated after having her period -- for a
moment, a brief moment, The Atmosphere Of Memory  starts to come to life. It works again whenever
those notebooks are read from by anyone in the show, moments which are all too few. Whatever freed theplaywright up when creating that dialogue from the past is unclear. but that's clearly the place he needs
to return.
