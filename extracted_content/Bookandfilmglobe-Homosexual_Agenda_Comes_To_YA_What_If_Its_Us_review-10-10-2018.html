<p>FICTION  Young Adult  
The Homosexual Agenda Comes To YA
Boys Meet Boys and Girls Meet Girls and No One Blinks
 October 10, 2018  Michael Giltz
The “gay boys in New York” young adult novel What If It’s Us  came out (joke!) on October 9 . That same day
also saw the release of Dear Evan Hansen , a novelization of the Broadway show that retains the musical’s
modest gay-friendly jokes and adds in a gay subplot; Odd One Out  by Nic Stone, which includes multiple teen
people of color and multiple sexual orientations; and Alan Cole Doesn’t Dance  by Eric Bell, a middle grade
novel about the further adventures of Alan, who chose to be openly gay one book earlier. And those are just the
ones I know about!
The most notable fact about this crush of queer teen novels is how un-notable they are. It’s not Gay Pride Month and having them all be releasedon the same day is pure happenstance, like when gay people meet at a non-gay event, such as when I’d bump into other queer folk in the bleachers atYankee Stadium. Oh hey, you too? What’s up?
Another common thread connecting these books is how grappling with
sexual orientation is so not the point. Ever since S.E. Hinton championedth</p>
<p>Ho-hum, just another gay YA
novelization of a Broadway play
← Lydia Millet’s Fight No More The Best Astronaut Movie That Ever Was →The Outsiders  and Judy Blume tackled every social issue imaginable like a
one-woman AfterSchool Special, young adult novels have proven
admirably realistic. Apparently, being realistic now includes being blaséabout queerness in all its varieties.
Few authors demonstrate that better than Becky Albertalli  (Simon Vs.   The
Homo Sapiens Agenda) and Adam Silvera  (They Both Die At The End)
who have hit home runs commercially with gay teen novels (among others)
and now team up to deliver a meet-cute romance between Arthur and Ben.Arthur is from Georgia but visiting NYC for the summer with his lawyer mom.   Ben is a proud Puerto Rican
New Yorker and they bump into each other at the post office   (ok, Arthur stalks him). They start chatting but a
flash-mob wedding proposal separates them (so  New York!) and they miss the chance to reconnect. But the
universe demands they meet up again and so they do, followed by a first date and then a do-over first date and
then a third  do-over first date and it’s all adorable and entertaining in a non-demanding way.
Both their parents and friends are beyond supportive and if it weren’t for a jerk on the subway who can’t handlethem snuggling in front of his kid, you’d swear this wasn’t set in the real world. The novel is pleasant enoughand zips by and is thoroughly undistinguishable from a thousand other boy-meets-girl teen romances. And isn’tthat pretty awesome? Sure, it’s been-there, done-that for adults who’ve read this stuff before. But for queerteens, it will probably be like that first kiss they’ll never forget.
