The Mentors  -- The results show begins with a list of all the mentors who will appear this season.
(The producers felt they spent too much time with the superstars and not enough time with the
kids, so this season there will be fewer mentors and they'll be focused more on helping the singersget ready.) The list is weighed a little towards mom and pop type acts, I guess, but it's a fun group.Dolly Parton should be a blast and I'll bet she's a terrific mentor who really helps them with singingand arrangements and performance. Mariah Carey one assumes would be useless -- doesn't sheneed six assistants to get up in the morning? But you never know -- plus, it would be really fun ifshe pretends not to know who Randy is. Andrew Lloyd Webber has been a judge on a UK realityseries and since he has Middle America tastes when it comes to big notes and big performances, hecould be a real help. And finally Neil Diamond, who has a new album coming out in May to follow-up the best CD of his career.
The Song Contest  -- They're going to try again with the song contest. They held it last season but
spent so little time promoting it, the event might never have happened. Songwriters definitely have
an edge this year: they KNOW they need to write a ballad that's in David Archuleta's wheelhouse.
Group Sing-Along  -- Another Up With People
moment in which the camera got lost and mosteveryone sounded flat and off...except for Kristy LeeCook of all people.
Carly Smithson/Bottom Three  -- I've been so
used to people loving her, that I didn't expect this at
all.
Brooke White/Safe  -- She told Ryan that "Here Comes The Sun" was out of her comfort zone.
Why? Because she was standing up? The song is a singer-songwriter ballad perfect for her that she
bungled. Is she clueless or just defensive? I'd say defensive since she can't shut up when the judges

Ford Commercial  -- Now we don't just watch the Ford commercial, we also watch a making-of
short. Good god. And while I love Idol, hearing them chirp The Clash's "Should I Stay Or Should I
Go" was a little soul-crushing. Unquestionably that's the least cool version of that song that we'll
ever hear. (I'm including the future and other alternate universes in that statement).
Kristy Lee Cook/Bottom Three  -- Duh. At least I got one right.
Live Phone Calls  -- Oh Lord, this is an unforgivable time waster. The only saving grace was that
Simon said he'd lock lips with Paula again because she's a very good kisser. When they cut away to
the kids, we heard Simon say off camera, "Get your lip gloss out, baby."
Kellie Pickler  -- Sang "Red High Heels" and wore a more demure dress this season. It was a
formulaic tune, even by country music standards. (I love country music as much as any other
genre, but they can really cobble together some anonymous tunes.)
Amanda Overmyer/Bottom Three  -- And is America waking up to her narrow range, too?
All women in the bottom three and though I think Amanda deserves to go most, I'm hoping it's
Kristy since she was the only person in my bottom three (along with Michael Johns and Ramiele
Malubay). So of course I'm almost completely wrong and it's Amanda that says goodbye. To her
credit, Amanda remains unflappable. Carly tears up at one moment, but weeping seems wrong for
this biker chick. The group hug at the end looked as awkward as possible.
Top Ten  -- So the top ten is David Archuleta, Michael Johns, Brooke White, Syesha Mercado,
Ramiele Malubay, Carly Smithson, Kristy Lee Cook, David Cook, Chikezie, and Jason Castro. Five
guys and five girls. The only ones I expect to give a good performance are David Archuleta, DavidCook, Syesha Mercado and maybe Brooke White. Carly Smithson has tons of support and a solidvoice. But the rest - Kristy Lee Cook, Chikezie, Jason Castro and Ramiele Malubay are just bidingtheir time until the tour begins. None of them will be in the finals. And my prediction right now(and please ignore it since I've been so wrong this season) is David Archuleta (of course) and DavidCook.
Who's your pick to join Archuleta in the final? And who is going home next week?

Do these contestants get any advice on their song choices? Either they were playing it very safe, or
they were unfamiliar with the songs at their disposal.
Amanda O. could have raged through "Helter Skelter" like Godzilla. I would have enjoyed it, although I
suppose Middle America would have freaked out over the Manson Family connection. Nevertheless, itwould have been memorable.
Jason Castro could have done so much better with any number of songs. "Girl" from "Rubber Soul"
would have been a swoonfest. He looked like a complete f*cktard singing "Michelle."
Either Kristy or Ramiele or Brooke could have done something with "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da." I would love
to hear that song reinterpreted with a Lily Allen-type arrangement (since it really is a ska song).
"Yesterday" was nice, but where was "Here There and Everywhere"? (Actually, I would have preferred
that from David A., as I think "The Long and Winding Road" is the drippiest Beatles song in theircatalog.) What about "Something" (hailed erroneously by Frank Sinatra as "the greatest song written byLennon and McCartney")? "The Fool on the Hill"? 
Even the Beatles lesser-known tracks are better than most artists' hits. I submit to you: "All I've Got to
Do" from "With the Beatles"), "For No One" (from "Revolver") and "Baby's In Black" ("Beatles for Sale")as three examples.
I also would have appreciated someone taking a stab at "Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except
for Me and My Monkey." And if anyone could have reimagined "Please Please Me" as the Roy Orbisonstyle number John Lennon originally intended it to be, I would have been over the moon.
Could they bring Paul McCartney on as a mentor next time they do this? He probably would, you know.

I'm responding to the top 10 episode of Idol. And, may I say, it blew my mind. What the
@#!@#!@# was that?An insipid song from an insipid songstress drew rave reviews from thejudges - for reasons I can only imagine to be cowardly. The fact that she sang a pro-Amercian jingle seemed to lull the judges into submission. Is that all it takes? A few tritewords about freedom (has no one been reading up on FISA?) gets the OK from the UK.Wow.

I would have kept Amanda over Kristy any day, but I guess she didn't look as good in plungingnecklines. Really, Smithson in the bottom three? What are the voters smoking? 
And please, please, don't let that little umpah loompah, Archuleta, win. He's so sweet he could give the
other half of the country without diabetes....well, diabetes.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
Smithson in the bottom three was def a surprise. But Amanda going before Kristy is noscandal -- neither one of them was going to go far. And you don't want Archuleta to win? Youhope in vain. It's even more inevitable than Carrie Underwood was. I'd spend your time
hoping your favorite gets to the finals - that's the best launching pad outside of winning and
probably the best you can hope for.

I think American Idol could probably conduct the primary election for Michigan and Florida. It wouldprobably be just as accurate as the real thing. Then the media could make a spectable of it for real.

Spot-on analysis, as always, Mr. Glitz. I also noticed the swells of crowd noise during Carly's renditionof Blackbird. After a second viewing of the performance I am convinced AI producers added cannedcheers while taping. The hoots and hollers sound unnatural.
Beatles notes from yesterday's blog:
Re Let It Be and The Long & Winding Road: Ryan stated Let It Be was the Beatles' last single release.
It was in fact the last authorized 45 release from the Beatles in March 1970. The Long & Winding Road
was released in May 1970, a month after Paul's announcement that he was leaving the group, but it
was only released by EMI-Capitol (on the Apple label) as a 45 in America. And yes, it did go to #1 -- inthis country. So, Ryan and David A were both right!
Day Tripper was of course the flipside of We Can Work It Out, but technically not its "B" side. We Can
Work It Out has proven to be the more popular track but the single was actually a double A-siderelease.
And finally, admittedly nitpicky on my part, but stating Yesterday is from the "Help! soundtrack" is a bit

misleading. It was issued as the penultimate cut on side 2 -- the non-soundtrack side of Help! -- with
the seven selections on side 1 comprising the actual "soundtrack" to the movie.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
I must disagree about your suggestion the producers "sweetened" the applause noise. Thesimplest reason is that it just isn't necessary -- any glimpse of the audience shows they're alltoo willing to wave their arms back and forth in unison or squeal at the drop of a hat. Plus, ifthey were sweetening the applause with canned sounds, I don't think they'd do it in such a
bizarre, awkward manner -- the crowd literally yelped at several points then quieted down in a
really strange, unnatural manner. If they were sweetening, frankly, it would have soundedmore "real." 
As for the trivia notes, nothing I like more than parsing this sort of thing. I erased the
episodes so I'll take your word Ryan said it was just their last official release instead of their
last #1. However, I sincerely doubt Ryan had in mind "their lst official release before the band
announced they would be splitting up." Further, nothing is done without their approval eventoday so it's not like three months later they had no say in what went on as far as theiralbums and what songs were released. As for the US-Uk dichotomy, you're right about thatbut we could write a book about the differences between releases in the two countries andagain, I imagine that was the last thing on Ryan's mind. The simple argument is that insteadof the hair-splitting you so deftly raised that he just got it wrong. "Let It Be" just "feels" like thelast song they'd release and that's why he thougt so. 
I've never understood how a single gets designated as a Double A-side rather than having an
A side and a B side. Can you explain that to me? I'd love to know. But given that as true,
then yes "Day Tripper" was the flipside but not the B side. Thanks for the clarification. 
Finally, you are not being nitpicky -- and yet you are. I should have made clear I was referring
to the official UK release of Help! (all CDs are currently based on the official UK versions of
course). The song "Yesterday" appears on the album "Help!" both in the UK originally andtoday on CD. (It didn't appear on the orginal US version of the soundtrack.) But referring tothe soundtrack side and non-soundtrack side is indeed nitpicky. The song is on the album. It'snot performed in the actual film but that's a whole 'nother story.
DCDan See Profile  I'm a Fan of DCDan  permalink
Glad you like parsing, as I do. Let's grind it out!
It is absolutely possible--even likely--that Ryan misspoke and got it "right"
accidentally. But the fact is, especially when using UK releases as standard, Let It
Be was their last single. And that's exactly how Ryan presented it. The Long &
Winding Road was not released as a single in the UK. At least he was consistent
throughout the show in referencing songs to UK releases (e.g., You Can't Do Thatfrom A Hard Day's Night as opposed to Capitol's slapdash Beatles 2nd Album).
You're right of course also that the Beatles would certainly sign off on releases
outside the UK. In the case of The Long & Winding Road, ironically perhaps in thecontext of our discussion, they most certainly did NOT sign off on its release as asingle. Paul McCartney has been on record since 1970 saying that he absolutelyabhors the final version of TL&WR, with Phil Spector's syrupy overdubs and all, andlobbied heavily against its release.
Finally, on the Help! thing we are really quibbling here. My point is, the UK Help!
album (like A Hard Day's Night) is not a true soundtrack, in that half the songs arenot in the movie. The soundtrack SIDE--tracks 1 through 7--is side 1; while none of
the side 2 tracks of Help! were ever considered for inclusion in the film. They are
just side 2 material for the album.

Gonna have to pass on the Mariah Carey deal. She couldn't even sing LIVE on SNL last week. Is she
going to teach them how to lip-synch? 
David Archuleta makes me really sad.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
Mariah's lip-synching on SNL was indeed very lame, especially for someone who technically
has a big voice. Don't let Archuleta make you sad. Think of all the teenyboppers he makeshappy. As I've said before, Archuleta is EXACTLY the sort of Idol winner the record labelsand the Idol producers expected the show uncover every season. Instead they got the healthylooking (ie not wafer thin) Kelly Clarkson, a hugely obese guy (with a nerdy runner-up), anilliterate single mom and on and on. So after seven seasons we get tiger beat pin-up? Not so
bad.

hmm.. pretty surprised Carly was at the bottom 3. She sang quite well in my opinion, so not totally sure
what happened there. I hope this is just an aberration, because I think she has the best voice of the
bunch (better than even David A) and she can actually win if this was a pure talent contest (which of
course its not). I was not a fan of hers at the beginning but she's growing on me, so I'm kinda rootingfor her, if anything to give David a run for his allowance money.No surprise Kristy was at the bottom, but I was a bit surprised Amanda got the boot. She's not a greatsinger, or even for that matter a good singer, but she has that something a lot of the other singers don'thave, Presence. You notice her on the stage, she may be a fright, but by golly you know its her upthere, belting out tunes in her limited range. Kristy is barely hanging on and we all know its mainly because she's pretty hot. She's got the babe votefrom the guys.I agree, David A is a sure lock on the finals, its be preordained since the beginning of the show. I'msure the producers of AI are chomping at the bit to put out this kid's CD and make a quick buck before
all the tweens get sick of him.
I also agree David Cook has a shot, but I'd also throw in Carly (if she can hang on to the end) and as a
dark horse, Syesha. She's got the look, voice and tenacity to make it to the finals Her "Yesterday" I
thought was brilliant and if she can build on that she has a shot. But I would like to see David Cook
duke it out with David A, it would be a great contrast in styles, looks, song choices, and age.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
Everyone else agrees w you about Carly of course. I've been a big fan of Syesha and hope"Yesterday" was a breakthrough for her and not a peak. She or Carly could certainly be thereat the end. I chose Cook at the moment because he's been the most consistent of ANYcontestant (including Archuleta) since breaking through with "Hello." Plus Michael Johns is nothreat and Amanda is gone so he's the only rocker, which helps. I too think they'd be a good
contrast in the finals.

The Group sing a long is actually a good idea especially since the Beatles were known for their ability
to harmonize. Unfortunately there wasn't that much effort put into this sing a long and so there was nothree part harmony, too bad.
Kristy Lee should go home but it sounds like they are all going to tour first. E-gads!

I was sure someone, somewhere would pass the "rattle off 5 hot ones" test but I think the
larger problem is that if someone attempts to sing these note for note, there will be injuries.
Do we want that kind of carnage on the American Idol stage?

mariah is going to be a mentor but I sincerely doubt the theme of the night will be
Mariah carey songs -- more like 90s night, just as Dolly parton (who has writtenprobably more than a thousand songs) will be helping them on country night ormaybe movie songs night. They will not limit the kids to singing Mariah Carey tunes.
That would be a horrific thought.

I don't think the role of a coach or mentor is to teach someone note for note how to
be me. A good coach will evaluate and recognize the strengths of an individualcompetitor and teach them how to improve.
Despite Mariah Carey's vocal gymnastics and ubra high pitch there remains a large
and unecessary amount of air escaping from her throat instead of music. It's asound you either like or dislike but in elite music circles it is not desirable.
On balance what she offers is more good than bad in fact pretty great and thus her
success.
I want to see the Mr. Dean Marin and Mr. Frank Sinatra impersonators be able to
sing the Beatles straight and do it with feeling, emotion, and complicated emptiness.

HuffPost's Pick
Carly Smithson in the bottom 3? Hmmmm, I'd have to say that I didn't see that one coming but, in theend we have been saved from the Amanda Overmeyer ballad you just knew had to be coming, thanks
to Paula's misguided urging. Things relating to music such as melody was a mountain that Amanda just
couldn't climb so, of course, "Back in the USSR" turned into a blues rocker (with fewer notes than Iremembered) instead of the Beach Boys homage it was designed to be.
Kristy Lee Cook, with a good natured smile on her face took her usual place in the bottom 3 only to
escape once again but, hey, there's always next week!
While the 'Live Phone Calls' segment should have been deep 6'd after the first time out, what remains
stupefying to me is posting the question on the big board before the persons asks it and then allconcerned having to feign some modicum of surprise like they didn't see that question coming. I don'tget it whatsoever. You're right though, at least Simon's kissing response had some entertainmentvalue.
Kellie Pickler...how I've missed that bumkin charm and while you're not the greatest voice on the block,
at least you delivered some sass into a pretty banal song. That song should have a label warning that
says 'don't try this unless you're as cute as Pickler and have a killer pair of red pumps'.
Mariah Carey? No, seriously, Mariah Carey? Quickly...rattle off 5 hot ones from the Carey catalog.
Why bother with the 'song contest'. The winning entry has been, and always will be, regardless of who's
writing it, just another piece of disposable music destined for the landfill 15 minutes after you hear it.Can you imagine if Blake Lewis had won last year and had to muddle his way though that tripe? Hewas obviously relieved from the prospect of that.
Seriously, Mariah Carey?

I'd had the same thought about the phone calls -- why is Simon looking confused about the
question -- can't he read the giant monitor looming over Ryan with all the questions printedout? At this stage, Kristy would probably freak out if she weren't in the bottom three. I agree
Blake Lewis was at some level relieved he didn't have to sing that song, though winning the
entire show would have taken the sting out of it. And again, Carey is a mentor but that
doesn't mean the theme will be Mariah Carey songs.

Simon looked confused because they only showed the first of two questions that the
caller had for them. The screen showed the kiss question. The other question was
about what Simon thought of Paula's new single.
