From the Publisher: In this hotly anticipated follow-up to the smash hit
IQ, a New York Times Critics' Best of the Year and nominee for the
Best First Novel Edgar Award, Isaiah uncovers a secret behind the deathof his brother, Marcus. For ten years, something has gnawed at Isaiah Quintabe's gut and kept him
up nights, boiling with anger and thoughts of revenge. Ten years ago,
when Isaiah was just a boy, his brother was killed by an unknownassailant. The search for the killer sent Isaiah plunging into despair andnearly destroyed his life. Even with a flourishing career, a new dog, andnear-iconic status as a PI in his hometown, East Long Beach, he has to
begin the hunt again-or lose his mind.
A case takes him and his volatile, dubious sidekick, Dodson, to Vegas,where Chinese gangsters and a terrifying seven-foot loan shark arestalking a DJ and her screwball boyfriend. If Isaiah doesn't find the two
first, they'll be murdered. Awaiting the outcome is the love of IQ's life:
fail, and he'll lose her. Isaiah's quest is fraught with treachery, menace,and startling twists, and it will lead him to the mastermind behind hisbrother's death, Isaiah's own sinister Moriarty.With even more action, suspense, and mind-bending mysteries than Isaiah's
first adventures, Righteous  is a rollicking, ingenious thrill ride.

What We Say
Joe Ide follows up his terrific debut "IQ" with a solid entry, a mystery not as immediately satisfying as the first in the series
but one that wisely sets him up for the long haul. Our hero Isaiah Quintabe -- aka "IQ" because he's so damned smart -- is acombination Sherlock Holmes/Easy Rawlins, super brainy but just as likely to be helping kids with a school bully as aShare This Book

<p>wealthy rapper. The first book told two stories: one that showed IQ on a current case and the other showing how this very
precocious and confident young man escaped a desperate childhood after the accidental death of his brother made IQ
embrace an easy life of crime. "Righteous" does a similar trick, though not as well. Here again we see IQ dealing with a
complicated case involving Vegas, gamblers up to their ears in debt, a prostitution ring and organized crime. That'scontrasted with a second story where IQ discovers his brother was murdered and becomes determined to figure out why. Inthe first book, IQ was always seven steps ahead of everyone else. Here, he's been "reset" -- we see him learning on the job,sometimes petulant, etc. His partner/sidekick is also fleshed out. Unlike Watson and so many others, Dodson is super
annoyed that IQ is so smart and never asks for an opinion or advice. Determined to prove himself, Dodson is nobody's fool
and that makes their dynamic fresh and surprising, a solid new twist on an old idea. The crime and its resolution isn't themystery's strength -- it's the characters, from the female deejay who loves her loser, gambling boyfriend to Dodson'spregnant woman, who stares down gangsters with unnerving calm. "Righteous" is a good book and Ide is playing the long
game by ratcheting down IQ's savvy and giving him room to grow. This should be a very good series. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
"Ide's debut, IQ, was one of last year's best crime novels, and he follows it with another scorcher. . . . Like the
great Thomas Perry, Ide manages to combine light and
dark in wholly unpredictable ways, blending comic capering with real-life bloodletting in a manner that
diminishes neither and taps a vein of deep emotion lurking amid the laugh lines and spurts of violence. Anyonewho loves Perry or Timothy Hallinan needs to hop on Ide's bandwagon while there's still room to sit.""Joe Ide is the best new discovery I've come across in a long time. And Isaiah Quintabe is the kind of sleuth not
seen on the mystery landscape before. Righteous  is a riveting follow up to IQ."âMichael Connelly, author of
The Late Show  - 
"Last year, Joe Ide became the best thing to happen to mystery writing in a very long time. . . . There are a lot
of fine reasons to discover Ide's work. . . . He writes thumbnail descriptions that rival Elmore Leonard's. . . . Hisdialogue, much of it unprintable here, has bite that puts him in the Winslow/Lehane league. . . . The world ofthese books is one of constant trash talk, and Ide delivers it with style. . . . It may be time for Ide to lay to restIsaiah's Marcus obsession and give him other things to think about. I can't wait to find out what they'll be."â Janet
Maslin , New York Times  - 
"Excellent... Ide keeps Righteous  on a righteous path of compelling storytelling, allowing his characters to
flourish while exploring the worst of human nature. Never once does Righteous  go over the top as Ide keeps
each plot point chillingly realistic... Ide's debut IQ showed what a skillful writer he is. Righteous  elevates the
author--and his characters--to a new level."â Oline Cogdill , The Associated Press  - 
"Ide is the real thing. This column was late, because I couldn't stop reading my advance copy."â Allison K. Hill ,
Long Beach Press-Telegram  - 
"Outstanding . . . Ide again makes his hero's deductive brilliance plausible, while presenting an emotionallyengaging story that doesn't shy away from presenting the bleakest aspects of humanity."â Publishers Weekly
(starred review)  - 
âBooklist (starred review)  - 
"Brilliantly executed . . . Deftly weaving the search for Marcus's killer with various escapades in Vegas, Ideemploys a clever mixing of time lines that will keep readers guessing until the explosive, bloody denouement. Awinning combination of skillful writing and flawless pacing, this second series outing is packed with adrenaline-inducing scenes along with a colorful cast of violent and treacherous villains."â Library Journal (starred review)
- 
"The game's afoot once again for 20-something genius sleuth Isaiah Quintabe. . . . [Ide] keeps your head in the
game throughout with his witty style and edgy storytelling, both of which show greater assurance than in hisfirst novel--and even bigger potential for the future. A thrilling follow-up to one of the more auspicious
detective-series debuts in recent memory."â Kirkus Reviews  - 
"Righteous  is action packed, cerebral and altogether engaging, and I predict a long string of follow-up novels in
this fine series."â Bruce Tierney , Bookpage  - 
"Introducing one of the best loved detectives in the recent annals of crime fiction... a shot of adrenaline for
Sherlock-style mystery lovers."â Dwyer Murphy , Lit Hub  -
