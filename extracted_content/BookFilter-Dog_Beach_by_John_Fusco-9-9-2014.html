Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayScreenwriter John Fusco is a rising star in Hollywood whose first novel -- Paradise Salvage -- received some positiveattention from crime enthusiasts. Here he's channeling Elmore Leonard and specifically "Get Shorty" in an attempt tosatirize the movie industry and secretly admit how much he loves it too. Unfortunately, "Dog Beach" falls between thebar stools -- not crazy enough to be a real satire and too stupid to be enjoyable as a peek behind the curtain. Troy isa wunderkind filmmaker who is making a cheapie zombie flick for a sleazy producer (is that redundant?). He can'tfinish editing this piece of junk which cost less than $200,000 to make and shows it in every frame. Frustrated, theproducer hires some muscle to scare the kid into turning in a finished product. (Because that's how Hollywood workswhen you've got dirty money behind your film.) But the muscle turns out to be legendary Hong Kong stuntman LouieMo, on the run from the Triads and a broken heart. Before you can say greenlight, the kid Troy and Mo are making adream project about an aging stunt man finally getting his turn in the spotlight -- all in about two weeks with four orfive people in the crew and with seemingly every shot being captured during "magic hour." It's hard enough making amovie, but even harder when a homicidal washed-up NFL quarterback, the Triads AND a Latino mobster are all onyour tail. If it sounds fun, it shouldn't, since this one lazily recycles numerous cliches to no effect. Here's hopingFusco rises to the occasion better with his Hollywood projects, including an upcoming Netflix miniseries "Marco Polo"and the long-awaited sequel to "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“Fusco channels Elmore Leonard and Quentin Tarantino in this vivid, action-packed tale of Asian gangsters andHollywood moviemaking.” - Publishers Weekly“Both Louie and the novel are wise and gently humorous, tougher than they seem, and casual about their mastery ofcraft. What follows is a fine romp, with sex, drugs, murder, and car chases, but savvy readers will notice theunderlying seriousness. And the insider stunt lore is priceless.”–Booklist  - "This is a poisonously funny Hollywood noir nightmare, smart and savage. I loved it." - Warren Ellis, author of Redand Gun Machine“I was always a big fan of Elmore Leonard, and now I’m a big fan of John Fusco. Dog Beach is a gem: A Hollywoodnovel by a guy who knows Hollywood. In this wonderful world of stuntmen and screenwriters, rising stars and fallingproducers, everyone is a step away from a blockbuster–if they can just stay alive to the final reel. Fast and funny andfilled with surprises.” - Chris Bohjalian</p>
