THEATER: "For Colored Girls" Returns. Finally!
FOR  COLORED  GIRLS  WHO  HAVE  CONSIDERED  SUICIDE/
WHEN  THE  RAINBOW  IS  ENUF  ** 1/2 out of ****
PUBLIC  THEATER  
Well, that's a relief! After decades of hearing about but never getting a
chance to actually see  the play  For  Colored  Girls:  Who  Have
Considered  Suicide/When  The  Rainbow  is  Enuf,  I assumed it must be
a dusty relic . It's not.
Playwright Ntozake Shange's work (last seen in a major NYC revival in
1995, apparently) is certainly of its time, the mid-1970s. But it's hardlydated. Shows devoted to women of color are still needed. Stories ofabuse and mistreatment and plain old indifference are still necessary.
And the simple brave acts of sharing those hungers and desires, of
admitting you fall and get back up, of finding strength in communityand sisterhood are still powerful.
Shange calls her combination of movement, dance, music and
poems/monologues a choreopoem. When first performing these
pieces, Shange simply couldn't stand still the way poets and authorswere politely expected to do. She just couldn't. She had to speak up, tospeak out, to get in motion . Sitting still was not an option. It still isn't.
Today, For  Colored  Girls  doesn't shock with its structure and style,
though it would still be a refreshing presence on Broadway. Decades ofpoetry slams and spoken word, revues, works of theater built arounddance and text quilted into a whole, and a growing if still-too-smallbody of work by women and people of color all make 
For  Colored  Girls
more familiar to audiences today. You can see where it came from andwhat it led to and, happily, you can judge it on its own terms as art,not just for its importance. On those terms, it's still vital if imperfect.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>For me, it plays like a revue. Seven women take the stage, each one in
a brightly colored dress and identified in the program as the Lady in
Blue, the Lady in Brown, the Lady In Orange and Red and so on.Disarmingly, they begin by echoing the chants and poems recited andremembered by little girls in playgrounds and streets for generations.Pretending to jump rope or skip or performing elaborate handmovements (or at least elaborate enough to bewilder any boys like me
watching from afar), the actresses cavort about the stage. Then the
action slides into more adult concerns with Shange effectivelydelivering her first and most important message: women find strengthand courage with each other from their earliest age and must never
give that up.
And they're off, with a monologue or poem gliding into a dance or song
and then back into another spoken word piece. The topics range fromlosing your virginity on the night of your high school graduation(finally!) to being harassed on the street to mocking men's endless
need to apologize to a childhood fascination with the hero Toussaint
Louverture to worrying you've made too much space for someone inyour life and crowded yourself out.
As with any revue, some pieces and performers land better than
others. For me, the moments that focused on the men and what they
did or didn't do were far less interesting than the ones that focusedinwardly on the women themselves. Turning the Lady in Purple into aperson with a hearing loss (played with expressive beauty byAlexandria Wailes) worked a treat. As the Lady in Blue, Sasha Allen of
The  Voice  let loose on the biggest vocal numbers. And in the Tony-
winning role of the Lady in Red, Jayme Lawson was a magnetic
presence. However, her big monologue about an abusive man has beendimmed by decades of seeing that story played out on cheap TV shows
and the like. Plus, real drama comes from how the Lady in Red would
deal with that pain, not the mere plot twist of what the man does. Still,her transition from a woman to a little girl begging daddy to be nice isbeautifully done and Lawson is definitely one to watch.
As the Lady in Brown, Celia Chevalier was the least compelling, butBOOKS: Don't Bother Trying To

<p>the collective group is strong enough to lift everyone's game up. Still,
this particular production has flaws. The staging by director Leah C.
Gardiner was a sort of in-the-round compromise. Most of the audience
is in traditional stadium seating facing the performance space. But
there is also a semi-circle of audience members on stage; it's likewatching people who are watching a show being performed in theround. And the performances certainly play to everyone. You feel theshow yearns to be done this way completely -- it's a communal
experience, after all -- but simply didn't have that as an option.
I also would love to see the musicians visible on stage, rather than
tucked away. (Not to get all John Doyle on you, but even the cast
might play instruments/percussion as well.) The scenic design of
Myung Hee Cho certainly did it no favors. A blurry, mirror-likereflective material encircles the stage and is effective. But clear plasticcrystals hanging from the ceiling give the room a chintzy '70s vibe.And revealing about a half dozen disco balls at the finale felt desultory.(They lowered about a foot from the ceiling in underwhelming
fashion.) Further, I am allergic to finger snapping as a sign of approval
or applause. Even done ironically, it makes me want to flee for the exit.That's one dated element that could be easily lost -- and replaced bythe more physical and inspiring raising of hands a-flutter, as one doesin appreciation of deaf performers, which appropriately makes anappearance here.
None of that detracted from the exuberance of a cast performing the
show the night I caught it, on the anniversary of Shange's birthOctober 18, 1948. We missed her being in attendance by just one year,
since she died on October 27, 2018. Which leads me back to the
original mystery. To be blunt, For  Colored  Girls  is a very inexpensive
work to put on. It made history by running on Broadway for 742performances, far longer than A  Raisin  In  The  Sun,  to make one
obvious comparison.   So what took them so long to bring it back?
Despite my cavils about this particular production, I'm delighted tosay, it's not because of the play itself. For  Colored  Girls  still has
something to say and it always will.
