From the Publisher: Sarah Gilchrist has fled London and a troubled past
to join the University of Edinburgh's medical school in 1892, the first yearit admits women. She is determined to become a doctor despite themisgivings of her family and society, but Sarah quickly finds plenty of
barriers at school itself: professors who refuse to teach their new pupils,
male students determined to force out their female counterparts, and—perhaps worst of all—her female peers who will do anything to avoid beingassociated with a fallen woman. Desperate for a proper education, Sarah
turns to one of the city’s ramshackle charitable hospitals for additional
training. The St Giles’ Infirmary for Women ministers to the downtroddenand drunk, the thieves and whores with nowhere else to go. In thisenvironment, alongside a group of smart and tough teachers, Sarah getsquite an education. But when Lucy,…

What We Say
This debut mystery has an engrossing setting and an engaging heroine. Sarah is an upper class woman in the late 1800s
whose reputation is destroyed when a man she cares for rapes her -- society of course treats Sarah like a fallen womanwhile the man goes unpunished. Even worse, she wants to study medicine and be a doctor. Yes, in 1892 a woman who
wants an education and a career is in many ways even more disreputable than a mere trollop. Sarah is banished to
Scotland, out of sight of her family but happily one of the few places women are tentatively allowed to pursue their passion.Sarah must fight the shunning of her fellow female students, the constant heckling (and worse) they all get from the maleShare This Book

<p>students, a prim aunt who wants to marry her off to a bore of a young man who is dimwitted and tiresome AND fight off
her growing feelings for a stern professor. Oh, and fight the urge to indulge in a taste for laudanum. Oh, and solve the
murder of a prostitute that no one cares about. It's good fun and the characters are vivid. But the setting and non-mystery
elements are much stronger than the mystery itself. Our heroine does very little detecting as such -- she merely stumblesacross various suspects and then impulsively follows them, for the most part. And she is rescued after stumbling onto thetruth, which is unsatisfying in every. While it fails as a mystery, Welsh does keep the pages turning and perhaps she'll makeher heroine more active in both solving the crime and protecting herself come the inevitable sequel. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
Sarah is a spunky but historically accurate heroine, bucking the most restrictive traditions in order to comment
on them. The first book in what will, one hopes, be a long-running series, featuring a new kind of historicalleading lady, Welsh’s debut is an inspiring feminist tale perfect for the modern age. - Library Journal (starred;
Debut of the Month)
Welsh makes clever use of the conventions of the genre while throwing in a twist informed by modern
sensibilities. Damp, sooty, moralistic, and sinning Edinburgh is convincingly evoked. A gritty detective story as
unflinching as its heroine, rich in well-researched period detail. - Kirkus Reviews
A moving, nuanced first novel. Superior characterizations and convincing period detail. - Publishers Weekly
It’s rare to find a truly fresh new voice in fiction. Welsh’s writing is intense, passionate, and dramatic. She turns
phrases until they’re exquisitely wrought, and fashions from the raw material of language something beautifuland unique. - Emma Rees, author of 'The Vagina: A Literary and Cultural History'
