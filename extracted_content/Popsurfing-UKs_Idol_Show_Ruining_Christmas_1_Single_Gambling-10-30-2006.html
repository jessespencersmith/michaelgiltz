            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  O C TO B E R  3 0 ,  2 0 0 6UK's "Idol" Show Ruining Christmas #1 SingleGamblingOK, in the UK there's a long tradition of celebrating whatever songhappens to be #1 during the week of Christmas. It used to behappenstance, of course, but now a lot of artists release "Christmas"singles (not songs with Christmas themes, per se, but holidayappropriate fare or just a huge, star-studded event) in hopes of beingthe winner of this year's Christmas slot. Naturally, since they're British,this also involves gambling. People wager lots of money on what songwill make it.Now that's all being spoiled by "The X Factor," Simon Cowell's realityshow that supplanted "Pop Idol" as the UK equivalent to "AmericanIdol." The first single from the winner of the show is always a massiveseller and now they're timing them to come out just in tiime todominate the pop charts come the holiday. It's ruining it for everyone,since the gambling this year says that the reunion single of super boyband Take That, hit group All Angels and even the UK's beloved CliffRichard are all pegged to fall short to "The X Factor" winner. That'sright, we don't even know who is gonna win but they're sure to beat anyand all superstars. Now THAT'S a hit TV show.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
