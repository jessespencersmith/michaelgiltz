8/29/2005 01:52:00 PMSen. John Warner of Virginia admits the obvious: voters arevery unhappy with Iraq. Warner's going to demand Rumsfeldcome testify to the Armed Services Committee."The level of concern is, I think, gradually rising," Mr.Warner said in an interview on Friday. "Our nation has givenso much to the Iraqi people, and what are they giving us inreturn?"He also made a vague promise to hold hearings in the next severalweeks on whether the Pentagon has failed to hold senior officialsresponsible for the prison abuse scandals. (Warner, we can save yousome time. The answer is "yes.") Maybe Dems could get us out ofthis mess if they weren't so mealy-mouthed. Steny Hoyer of Maryland-- the number two Dem in the House -- said this:"I think the public is losing patience with the effort becausethey don't see it succeeding. In fact, from theirperspective, they see the attacks increasing. Wehaven't done what we need to do for the infrastructure inIraq. We haven't got the economy going."They don't see it succeeding? Who does? From THEIR perspective theattacks are increasing? Is there a "perspective" where the attacksAREN'T increasing? The non-reality based perspective of Bush,perhaps? Attacks ARE increasing. Deaths are increasing. Theinsurgency is increasing. If the Dems are afraid of stating obviousfacts, how are they going to earn the trust of voters?
