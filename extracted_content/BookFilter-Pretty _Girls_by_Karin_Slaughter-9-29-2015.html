Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayKarin Slaughter is a big name in mystery, a "brand name" author whose fans have bought her novels in the tens ofmillions around the world. Well, she's about to get bigger. Her new stand-alone thriller Pretty Girls is a roller coasterof a tale, filled with twists and turns, each one more jaw-dropping, unnerving and just plain fun than the one before.But it also retains Slaughter's gift for genuine, complex characters and that makes the danger palpable, the stakesreal, the emotions raw. The story begins long after a tragedy. Claire and Lydia are the sisters who "survived" whentheir sibling Julia was abducted off a college campus two decades earlier. Of course their family was never the same.Their father became obsessed with the case and died alone; their mother won't discuss it; and the two sisters areestranged. Claire has the successful marriage, the country club membership and the showcase home. Lydia is arecovering addict (and sex worker) dating an ex-con. But nothing is as it seems: a violent murder upends Claire'sworld and pulls Lydia back into her orbit. Slowly we realize Lydia is on the road to recovery, Claire is on a slide intoturmoil and they're both being haunted and hunted by a spectre from the past. Without ever shortchanging theadrenaline rush of a thriller, Slaughter has crafted characters far more compelling than the usual cardboard cut-outswhich pass for people in most such genre fare. It's a triumph that will bring this author to a wider audience than ever.And that's saying something. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat Others Say“A stunning family tragedy and a hold-your-breath pedal-to-the-metal thriller magically blended by Karin Slaughter’strademark passion, intensity, and humanity.
