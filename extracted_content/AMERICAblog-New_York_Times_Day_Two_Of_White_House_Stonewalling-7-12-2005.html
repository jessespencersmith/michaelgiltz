7/12/2005 04:00:00 PMHere's the latest hit from the MSM. The New York Times paintsa White House under siege (my wording), with this nifty byplaybetween Bush and reporters.President Bush was asked today if he planned to fire KarlRove, a senior aide at the center of an investigation overthe unmasking of an undercover C.I.A. officer, and heoffered only a stony silence in reply.... "Are you going tofire him?" the president was asked twice in a brief OvalOffice appearance with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong ofSingapore. Both times, the president ignored the questions.I love that this happened during a cozy meeting with the autocraticruler of Singapore, just his kind of guy when Bush forgets he'ssupposed to be spreading democracy, not propping up the bad guys.And please, counting down the days of silence by the White House isa great idea. Day Two....
