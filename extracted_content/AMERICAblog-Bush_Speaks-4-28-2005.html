4/28/2005 01:34:00 PMIn a rare foray into reality, Bush will hold a press conferenceThursday night at 8:30 p.m....and then take questions from(mostly) real reporters. No reason why Jim Guckert shouldn'tbe there, right? Bush is so used to fake town meetings andmaking sure everyone he comes in contact is prescreened for"loyalty" that it should be a shock for him to face genuinequestions.According to the New York Times, he'll weigh in for ten minutesor so on Social Security, his failing plan to gut it and high gasprices. White House official Scott McClellan insists Bush will"talk in more specific ways" about his plan for Social Security.You mean, after a year of insisting its in dire straits he mightactually commit to naming a specific idea or two?Shame on the reporters if their first question doesn't focus onwondering why Bush insists on privitization when he says thatsolvency is the big problem and he's already admitted thatprivitization won't help increase solvency by a single penny.(Not to mention create trillions of dollars in debt over the nextdecade.)What questions would you ask Bush if you had the chance?
