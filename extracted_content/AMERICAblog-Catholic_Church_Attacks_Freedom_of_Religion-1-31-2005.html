1/31/2005 09:57:00 PMHey, who misses the Inquisition? Apparently the CatholicChurch, which has never been comfortable with genuinedemocracies. They're now joining with the Mormons, Hindus,Muslims, Sikhs and Orthodox Jews to attack freedom of religionin Canada and make the practices of major religions they hateillegal under the law.I'm talking of course about gay marriage. Eighty five percent ofCanadians already live in areas where marriage rights areextended to all people and the valid marriages of theEpiscopalians, Reform Jews, MCC, Unitarians and othermainstream religions are respected and treated as valid. Butthe Church is waging an unholy war against a bil coming toParliament in early February that would legalize same sexmarriage -- and therefore treat the practices of all majorreligions equally rather than singling some out as invalid.This is not about same sex marriage. That is a fact of life and itwill never go away -- neither will marriages between people ofdifferent races, different religions or marriages between adultswho are 40 years apart in age and anything else some mightfind distasteful that many religions would bless. So don't letthem make this an argument about gay people. It's anargument about freedom of religion. Why should the tenets ofthe Catholic Church become the law of the land while thetenets of the Unitarians should be made illegal? Why areOrthodox Jews good people of faith while Reform Jews areleading to the end of civilization? Why are Mormons godlypeople and MCCers attacking the very pillars of society? Whydoesn't the Catholic Church oppose every politican who keepsdivorce legal? Why am I still surprised and angry -- as apracticing Catholic -- at how much the Church and its tacticshave changed in the past ten years?
