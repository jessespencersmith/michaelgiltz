10/19/2004 05:33:00 PMDick Cheney -- can we just call him Dick now? -- is at it again. Theman who never suggested a link between Hussein and 9-11 -- exceptof course when he WAS suggesting a link between Hussein and 9-11-- is playing the fear card again. After being excoriated for suggestinga few weeks ago that a vote for Kerry would mean more terroristattacks in the U.S., Cheney has upped the ante.``The biggest threat we face now as a nation is the possibility ofterrorists ending up in the middle of one of our cities with deadlierweapons than have ever before been used against us -- biologicalagents or a nuclear weapon or a chemical weapon of some kind to beable to threaten the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans,''Cheney said, according to the NYT.And does Cheney believe Kerry would be as aggressive and strong asBush?``I don't believe it,'' the vice president said. ``I don't think there'sany evidence to support the proposition that he would, in fact, do it.''What a shock. Of course, under Bush, insurgents in Iraq have walkedaway with massively heavy equipment and material needed to buildnuclear weapons. It took days to dismantle and then spirit across theborder. Some of the yellow cake has already popped up in Europe.Under Bush, it would take 14 years to secure all the loose nuclearweapons and material spread out through the unstable, increasinglyautocratic former Soviet Union. Kerry has a plan to secure it in four.So if Cheney's right about this threat, Kerry's your man.And isn't it crazy that Kerry is criticized for stretching the truth whenhe warns about a draft (Hello! There's already a backdoor draft withthousands of troops dragooned into serving in Iraq when they didn'tvolunteer and would rather be home.)?But when Cheney says if you vote for Kerry it means nuclear bombsgoing off in American cities, it's just tough talk?
