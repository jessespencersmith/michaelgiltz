            <p>Newer PostOlder PostF R I D AY,  O C TO B E R  0 6 ,  2 0 0 6Barry Manilow Shocker!Barry Manilow's "The Greatest Song of the Fifties" debuted at #1 andwas his biggest non-greatest hits hit in many, many years. The sequel --"The Greatest Songs of the Sixties" debuts October 31. And now, in astunning development, Manilow has revealed that he might in factrecord "The Greatest Songs of the Seventies." "Well, it seems like thereshould be one," Manilow told Billboard about this bombshellrevelation. But what will be next? "The Greatest Songs of the Forties"or "The Greatest Songs of the Eighties?" (Actually, Manilow would bewiser to do the Forties first. He could tackle "Paper Doll,""Heartaches," "In The Mood" (yep, there are lyrics), "The Gypsy,""Rider in the Sky," "I'll Never Smile Again," and even "WhiteChristmas," along with a host of others that would be a lot moreinteresting for him to tackle than, say, "You Light Up My Life." Oh God,he WILL record "You Light Up My Life," won't he?POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
