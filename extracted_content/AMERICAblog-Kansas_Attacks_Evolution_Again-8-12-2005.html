8/12/2005 12:50:00 PMKansas actually does a pretty good job of disproving evolution:how else to explain a state regressing from the site of asymbolic victory for academic freedom to the most famousplace in America that wants to dumb down the education itschildren receive?The Kansas State Board moved one step closer to demandingreligious beliefs be taught in science class, showing the boardmembers apparently don't understand what science or a"theory" or "evidence" is any better than a poorly taught ninthgrader. A final vote will be held in September or October. Afterthat, kids can be certain that religious beliefs will trumpscientific fact and that they'll be ill-prepared for college, whereno public university in the country will accept far right dogmaas answers in a science course. Among the losers: anyone offaith who doesn't happen to agree with the far right's religiousagenda: now their children will be forced to learn the religousbeliefs of other families instead of their own, and under theguise of science.In honor of this, Americablog has obtained some exclusivepeeks at what future test questions in science and math andother areas will be like in Kansas after the revamping. See howyou do!Question: What does DNA stand for?Answer: God.Question: What is 21 divided by 7?Answer: God.Question: Which came first, the Constitution or theDeclaration of Independence?Answer: The Bible.
