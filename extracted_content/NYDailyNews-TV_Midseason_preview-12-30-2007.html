Midseason highlights will be hit-or-miss By Mrcrranl, crr.rz
hanks to the writers strike, TV has been thrown into chaos. But
after weeks of repeats and confusion, the midseason will kick
off with new episodes of most late-night talk shows and the un-
killable "American Idol." In addition to their peturning shows,
the networks are preparing new programs, reality stunts, mini-
series and specials to flood the airwaves and recapture our at-
tention. Here's a selection to watch for in the coming months.
