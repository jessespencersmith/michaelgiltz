7/13/2005 03:39:00 PMOne of the tricks Bush likes to pull is cloaking a tax for thesuper-wealthy as a break for the "little guy." A prime example:the estate tax. Bush is disheartened to think multi-millionairekids like Paris Hilton could be forced to pay some taxes whenmommy and daddy die, so he would love to kill the estate tax.His biggest whopper: we have to give Paris a tax break or itwill hurt the family farm. Bush likes to claim they and smallbusinesses are hampered by the estate tax. Attack ads arealready on TV. Any Senator who thinks the super-rich shouldpay some taxes before loading up their children with wealthbeyond most of our wildest dreams? Why, they hate farmers.Uh-uh. The Congressional Budget Office reports that thenumber of farms on which estate tax is owed has fallendramatically to about 300 farms. It also hinted that the numberof farms which owed taxes after using liquid assets (ie. thefarm is fine and they had enough money to pay off any taxes),well that could be zero. Zip. Nada. Damn, I hate facts.According to the New York Times,President Bush, the American Farm Bureau Federation andthe National Cattlemen's Beef Association have assertedthat the estate tax is destroying family farms. None,however, have cited a case of a farm lost to estate taxes,although in June 2001 Mr. Bush said he had talked to suchfarmers....Michael J. Graetz, a professor at Yale Law School who was atax policy official in the administration of President GeorgeBush, said repeal was primarily a benefit to people withlarge estates held in stocks and other securities, not tofarmers....And just to screw over the farmers Bush is pretending to help:Because of details in the repeal bill, it would also force alarge majority of farms and small businesses to pay largertax bills in the future, said John Buckley, the chief taxlawyer for Democrats on the House Ways and MeansCommittee. Mr. Buckley criticized farm and small-businessgroups as not explaining to their members that the repealas written would cost them money while primarilybenefiting those with vast fortunes.
