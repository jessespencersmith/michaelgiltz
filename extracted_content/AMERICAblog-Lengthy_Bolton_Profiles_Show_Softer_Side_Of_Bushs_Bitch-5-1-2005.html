5/01/2005 12:42:00 PMTwo lengthy profiles of Bush UN nominee John Bolton provide afuller picture of the guy. The New York Times gives us his lifestory, with one notable success including working at the UN toget foreign diplomats to agree they'd repeal the UN resolutionequating Zionism with racism. The LA Times has a long profiletoo, with its angle being that much of the complaints againstBolton are payback from a far more moderate StateDepartment where he butted heads with Powell and all theless-than-far-right career folk ensconced there. (The StateDepartment was basically enemy territory to the far right.)But here's the less-than-encouraging quote from Condi Riceabout Bolton, per Senate aides."We think that we can control him," Rice told one senator,two Senate aides said. "If he strays from the reservation, he'sout."They THINK they can control him. Wow, what an endorsementfor a diplomat.
