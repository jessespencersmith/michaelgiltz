            <p>T U E S D AY,  A P R I L  1 8 ,  2 0 0 6Vatican Pulls Out The Stops To Promote "Da VinciCode"Okay, in fact the Vatican and far right Catholics are trying to denounce"The Da Vinci Code" (both the book and movie) but all they're reallyaccomplishing is keeping a white-hot spotlight on the massivelypopular novel and implying that its ludicrous plot twists must havesome grain of truth. First, the Preacher of the Papal Householddenounced the book in a sermon. (You would think the Papalhousehold would be the LAST one to need a preacher, but whatever.)He did it very coyly, denouncing the book and saying the problemswould continue "with the imminent release of a certain film." A certainfilm? You mean, "The Da Vinci Code" which opens Cannes on May 17and then opens around the world on May 19? Then the nasty little cultgroup Opus Dei -- which doesn't think even married couples shouldhave sex (an exaggeration, but true in spirit) -- insists that the fictionalfilm based on a fictional novel should carry a disclaimer so peopleknow that it's...fiction. How stupid are they? Anyone who wondered ifit could possibly be true that Jesus didn't die on the Cross and hitchedup with Mary Magdalene would have all their suspicions confirmed bythe actions of the Vatican. They couldn't have done more to bolster DanBrown's credibility if they tried.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
