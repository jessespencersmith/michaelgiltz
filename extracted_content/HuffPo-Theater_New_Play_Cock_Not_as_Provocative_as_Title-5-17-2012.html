 Amazing Inspiring Funny Scary Hot Crazy Important WeirdTheater: New Play Cock  Not as
Provocative as Title, Sad to Say
COCK  ** 1/2 out of ****
THE DUKE ON 42ND STREET
Do you want to see Cock ? Did you like Cock ? Is Cock
worth paying for? If nothing else, the new play by Mike
Bartlett (the acclaimed Earthquakes in London )
provides some juvenile fun for theatergoers.
Unfortunately, the play is not nearly as provocative as its title, a title it never comes close to needing orearning.
The story is a flip on an old tale. Instead of a man leaving his wife for another man, it's about John (Cory
Michael Smith), a gay man in a long-term relationship who suddenly finds himself attracted to a womanfor the very first time. John can't decide who to choose (or even who he is, really -- gay, straight, bi,
committed, philandering?) and it all climaxes in a very awkward dinner party. John's boyfriend (Jason
Butler Harner) believes John is going to tell the woman that it's all over. Nonetheless, the boyfriendinvites his father (Cotter Smith) to join them for moral support. The woman (Amanda Quaid) naturally
believes John is going to end it with his partner and announce his love for her. John dithers and they
realize he has absolutely no idea what he wants or needs. Neither do we and, unfortunately, Bartlett's
play never makes us care very much either way
It's a smoothly entertaining piece nonetheless, with director James Macdonald handling the showdowns
between actors quite nicely. The scenic and costume design is by Miriam Buether, who has built a circular
boxing ring, with seating in the round on raised platforms that let the audience sit in judgement or
perhaps cheer on their favorite protagonist a la a sporting event. There are no props, with actors simplyoffering to take someone's coat or pour them a drink without actually bothering to do the deed. It keeps
the focus squarely on the real action, the battle for John to figure out exactly what he wants.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

The constant squaring off works nicely, with a seduction scene being a real highlight. John and the
woman circle each other while verbally working their way towards coitus in a bit of gamesmanship that is
sexy and amusing at the same time. (It helps that Smith and Quaid have the best chemistry.)
So what goes wrong? First, Harner gives a mannered performance, with all his lines delivered in quotes.
He's always quoting "dialogue" instead of just speaking. That alone throws the play out of whack. If we
don't like the boyfriend, we can't feel a great amount of tension about whether or not they stay together.
Plus, it soon becomes clear that John is not happy in their relationship. He claims, at least, that his
boyfriend is patronizing and makes him feel small and not terribly bright. Maybe none of this is true;
maybe he's just besotted with the new. But John's indecisiveness is unappealing and he makes theirrelationship seem poor. So maybe he's not bisexual and maybe he's just using this woman as an excuse tofantasize about a happier life but if we don't think the boyfriend is worth being with we can't feel terribly
much is at stake.
Quaid gives the most convincing performance, though her big breakdown at the end doesn't quite deliver.
Smith is better than his character, a frustrating fellow that doesn't know what he wants. Insecurity can be
charming, at least that's what Albert Brooks wanted us to believe once upon a time. But indecision palls,
even in a brisk 90 minute play. Smith does able supporting work as the loving and accepting father. It all
deflates into a very unsatisfying resolution that leaves us pretty much where we started except for a
would-be haunting last line that instead just annoys.
Then there's the title. If you introduce a gun in act one, by golly you better fire it off in act three. And if
you call your play Cock , it better be a button-pushing bit of provocation that toys with gender and
sexuality in ways both funny and shocking. We keep waiting, not unreasonably, for Cock's  big moment, a
soliloquy to sex, a panegyric to the penis, a colloquy on cock. And what do we get? Nothing. You walk outof the play without a clue as to why it's called what it's called.
I've heard good things about Bartlett and my discriminating guest says his play Earthquakes In London
was much better. This comedy is certainly well-constructed and thanks to a generally fine cast (even the
weakest performance isn't that bad) perfectly watchable. But when you show someone Cock , having them
say "not bad" isn't just faint praise; it's positively deflating.

There's one thing this reviewer failed to mention about this theatrical experience. You have to sit on
backless benches and cushions for the play which runs about 90 minutes with no intermission. Ifound that to be agony, given my bad back. People should be forewarned.

That's a good useful point to make. The theater does make a point of saying if youneed/want a back to your seat that the "premium" seating is in the top row where peoplecan lean back against a wall. I'm used to bleachers at Yankee Stadium so didn't actuallythink about it. Thanks for letting people know.HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 2

Cocky...

Actually that word came about to mean penis a long, long time ago. Words become acceptable,
then non-acceptable thru the centuries. You cannot say that word now without someone blushing.People forget it's a rooster.
But leave it to broadway to find a way to titilate the play-going crowd.
09:07 AM on 05/20/2012
I was totally riveted. The actors verbally working their way towards coitus is something that has to
be seen and not heard.
02:40 PM on 05/19/2012
Not as good an article as I anticipated lol.. The play don't sound that great either.
09:09 AM on 05/20/2012
No it don't. Mayhaps you could find a gooder one yonder I reckon.
01:41 PM on 05/19/2012
According to HP, use this word and "you will be reported.". Hahahahahahagagagagaga

What? No roosters? ;-)

The play sounds like it sucks.
