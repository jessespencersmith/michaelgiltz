aDANGER ON HIGH
N n 1996, Mount Everest was the scene of one of the worst climbing disasters
$ in history. Bizarrely, that only spurred more climbers and thrill-seekers
$ into tacklinO the world's highest peak. Now a mountain of cash has turned
S Everest into a scene of prostihrtion, drug use, petty theft, murderous rages,
unscrupulous guides, clueless climbers who endanger not only their own lives but
also others, and more. The slopesare so crowded that climbers must walk past
the dead and dying - sometimes out of callousness, sometimes because they
have no choice and can barely save themselves.
Climber and joumalist Michael Kodas demystifies Everest and tells of the
dangers he faced when attempting to summit himself in his new book "High
Crimes: The Fate of Everest in an Age of Greed" (Hyperion; $24.95).

lttlK:lt's myth-busting. So much that comes off the
mountain is exaggeration at best. lt's like the celebrity
journalism that surrounds athletes now except ifs
in a location so remote you're unlikely to be able to
puncture anything they want to, say.

MJC: lwas blinded by
this, too. You get an
opportunity to be a
part of an expedition to
Everest and you put the
blinders on and don't
want to look at it too
closely because you're afraid you're going to lose this
chance. Some people spend more time and diligence
looking into the background of the person who is
going to paint their house than the person they're
going to be tied to on Mount Everest.

I can't say.
