11/05/2004 01:40:00 PMYep, Russia and Czar Putin (its the same thing) have signed off on theKyoto Accord, putting it over the top for ratification. It needed 55industrialized nations to go into effect. The U.S. and Australiarejected it. But after years of delay, Russia signed on in exchange forthe EU backing its entry into the World Trade Organization.Amusingly (or sadly), Putin finally decided to go ahead despitewarnings from his economic adviser, who said Kyoto would stymiegrowth of the economy. His reason? The country's financial meltdownis so severe that right now it's 30% below the benchmark for toughmeasures anyway -- in other words, Russia has slid backwards somuch its in no danger of triggering the more serious steps called tocombat global warming.
