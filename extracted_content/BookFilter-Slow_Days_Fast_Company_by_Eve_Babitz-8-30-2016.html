Slow Days, Fast Company

Rating: 0.0/ 5 (0 votes cast)
From the Publisher: No one burned hotter than Eve Babitz. Possessing
skin that radiated “its own kind of moral laws,” spectacular teeth, and a
figure that was the stuff of legend, she seduced seemingly everyone who
was anyone in Los Angeles for a long stretch of the 1960s and ’70s. Oneman proved elusive, however, and so Babitz did what she did best, shewrote him a book. Slow Days, Fast Company  is a full-fledged and full-
bodied evocation of a bygone Southern California that far exceeds itsmash-note premise. In ten sun-baked, Santa Ana wind–swept sketches,Babitz re-creates a Los Angeles of movie stars distraught over theirsuccess, socialites on three-day drug binges holed up in the ChateauMarmont, soap-opera actors worried that tomorrow’s script will kill them
off, Italian femmes fatales even more fatal than Babitz. And she even
leaves LA now and then, spending an afternoon…

What We Say
Where has Eve Babitz been all my life? This classic memoir of Hollywood was penned by Babitz, who has written acclaimed
novels, collections of nonfiction and even once designed album covers for The Byrds, Linda Ronstadt and the like. Thanks tothe invaluable New York Review Books (the Rhino Records, the Criterion Collection of curating titles you really must pay
attention to in publishing), now I know I've got to track down everything she's done. Imagine "Valley Of The Dolls" if penned
by Jane Austen and you'll have a sense of how fun and perceptive it is. In his marvelous introduction, Matthew Specktor ofLos Angeles Review Of Books neatly demolishes the double standard for female writers who enjoy drugs and sex --Share This Book

<p>Hemingway and Bukowski are geniuses while women of similar tastes are of course party girls. Similarly, men who traffic in
gossip and the upper crust are gimlet-eyed observers of society while women are light and frothy and fun, but not serious
writers. Babitz is most definitely a serious writer. In this memoir she engages you so easily and informally that her
observations on fame and power and the eternal mysteries of men and women and sex glide by, never calling attention tothemselves. It's addressed to a Man she couldn't have and so seduces with words, her most potent weapon, which is sayingsomething since Babitz had it going on. In ten sketches, one sees on the surface all sorts of glamorous Hollywood moments:piles of cocaine, threesomes, dating a gayish man, a starlet on the cusp of fame who is freaking out, divorce, weekends in
Palm Springs, the Chateau Marmont and so on. Fans of Carrie Fisher should dive right in. But as Specktor says, emphasizing
the wit and glamour (which is here in abundance) can slight the significant literary merits on display. It's almost shockinghow timely the book seems about LA, even though it was published in 1977. Toss in a few cell phones and maybe somedifferent drugs and you'd swear it came out today. But of course Hollywood doesn't really change because human naturedoesn't really change. Babitz sucker punches us with one of her cruelest sketches, a withering put-down of a housewife of
means that Babitz can't take seriously...only to have that woman commit suicide and allow that lack of empathy to rebound
beautifully on Babitz herself (and us). And a sketch where she goes to perhaps her first baseball game (with a marriedstudio exec) and is immediately besotted by the game is so good about masculinity and the Ideal Man and the pleasures ofthe crowd that it's a jewel all on its own. As is this memoir, which is dishy, funny, wise and wonderfully written. -- Michael
Giltz
What Others Say
“Her writing took multiple forms. . . . But in the center was always Babitz and her sensibility—fun and hot and
smart, a Henry James–loving party girl.”  —Naomi Fry, New Republic
“Babitz takes to the page lightly, slipping sharp observations into roving, conversational essays and perfecting akind of glamorous shrug.”  —Kaitlin Phillips, Bookforum
"[Babitz] achieved that American ideal: art that stays loose, maintains its cool, is purely enjoyable enough to be
mistaken for simple entertainment. It’s a tradition that includes Duke Ellington, Fred Astaire, Preston Sturges, Ed
Ruscha, and, it goes without saying, Marilyn Monroe.”  —Lili Anolik,  Vanity Fair
“Babitz' collection of essays, Slow Days, Fast Company , the best non-fiction written about the Joys of Sensuous
LA, I have always thought right up there with Joan Didion's Slouching Towards Bethlehem .”—Lee Grove, Boston
Globe “Eve Babitz was Los Angeles' greatest bard. Promiscuous but discerning, the bombshell with a brain bonded withJoan Didion and bedded Jim Morrison… Babitz is finally getting the literary comeback she deserves.” —LiliLoofbourow, The Week
