Playing to the Gods
By Peter Rader$26, Simon & Schuster
This dual biography tells the stories of two of the greatest stage actresses in history: Sarah
Bernhardt (the Divine One, as good at self-promotion as she was at acting) and Eleanora Duse(a self-effacing artist who pioneered modern acting). It’s juicy and delightful. Both women camefrom hardscrabble backgrounds, with the French Bernhardt the daughter of a courtesan and theItalian Duse the daughter of itinerant actors. Bernhardt was a genius at marketing andmerchandising — she ran her own theater company and put her face on everything from fans toface cream. Her scandalous exploits were headline news all over the world and she wasdelighted, for Bernhardt played the press like an impresario. Duse preferred not to speak to thepress at all, saw acting as a spiritual act, and disappeared into her roles. Bernhardt was a star,

<p>always the same in every play; Duse was an artist,  devoted to the roles and the emotions of her
characters. Bernhardt was the last of the great posers, the actors who took specific, detailed
stances on stage to evoke emotions, all of it worked out in advance, all of it mechanical, and, inher case, always, always winking at the audience. Duse was among the first of the true actorsas we understand acting today, influencing Stanislavski and his Method acting (which sheembodied even before it had a name). These two women circled each other warily, competingfor lovers and roles, but wisely valuing the roles over lovers every time. Their competition peakswith an insane showdown in which they both appeared in London across the street from eachother … playing the same role in the same play.
Just when you’re ready to start casting the next season of TV’s Feud,  author Peter Rader digs
further. He shows how Bernhardt rose to the challenge of Duse and deepened her craft. He also
gives her credit for brave public stances, such as when the Jewish Bernhardt stood tall duringthe Dreyfus Affair. That’s all to the good for Bernhardt, since she may have won the battle (westill know her name), while Duse so clearly won the war when it came to acting. Rader isstrongest on the specifics of their lives, a little weaker when he steps outside the facts of thestory at hand (such as erroneously saying Marlon Brando’s appearance in A Streetcar NamedDesire  was his Broadway debut; it was I Remember Mama  some three years earlier, followed by
four more shows before Streetcar ). Anyone who loves theater, acting in general, and strong
women from history in particular will enjoy Playing to the Gods  very much.
