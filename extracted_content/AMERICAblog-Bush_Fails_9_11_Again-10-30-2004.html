10/30/2004 02:49:00 PMIt's official: Bush has failed on 9-11 every step of the way. Bush failedto prevent the biggest attack on US soil since World War II. Bushfailed to hold ANYONE in his administration responsible for the singlegreatest intelligence failure in decades if not our entire history. Bushfailed to hunt down and kill Osama Bin Laden. Bush failed to supporta serious inquiry into the failures of our government by the 9-11commisson. Bush failed to cooperate with that commission every stepof the way. Bush lied by claiming he supported the commission'srecommendations but has now failed again in getting those reformsput into action. Yep, everyone now agrees that the desperatelyneeded reform of our intelligence agencies (and of Congress'soversight of those agencies) is NOT going to happen before theelection.
