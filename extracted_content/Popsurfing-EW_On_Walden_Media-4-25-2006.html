            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT U E S D AY,  A P R I L  2 5 ,  2 0 0 6EW On Walden MediaEntertainment Weekly has a good feature on the family friendlyindependent studio Walden, which backed "Narnia," "Holes," and theupcoming "Hoot." Cary Granat is the creative force behind it and Iloved the story of his blinding revelation about what types of movies heshould work on. In 1997, Granat walked into his living room where he'dcarelessly left some dailies from Scream 2. His two year old daughterwas watching the horrific killer stalking his victim and she wasfrightened out of her wits. Granat realized he didn't want her growingup in a world saturated with that kind of pop culture. Two things. First,almost NO movie -- romantic, dramatic, funny, scary or whatever -- isappropriate for a two year old, INCLUDING the family friendly"Chronicles of Narnia." If he walked in on his daughter terrified out ofher wits as she watched Aslan being killed, would he vow never to makefantasy films based on children's books? I love it when people come tothe horrific conclusion that pop culture should be safe for littlechildren. No, she doesn't need a new film production company.Granat's daughter just needs a parent who DOESN'T LEAVE HORRORMOVIE FOOTAGE LYING AROUND WHERE SHE CAN GET TO IT.What kids need are good parents, not a pop culture denuded of allvariety so it is "safe" for little tykes.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
