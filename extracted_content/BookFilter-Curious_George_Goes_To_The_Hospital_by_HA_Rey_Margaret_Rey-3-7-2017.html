What We Say
For decades, kids have been given a copy of "Curious George Goes To The Hospital" before heading in for surgery or just to
prepare themselves for a visit with ailing family or friends. I know I read it as a child before my operation. (Nocomplications, I'm happy to say!) Though I haven't seen this book since I was 10 or 12, I immediately remembered the story.
George swallows a piece of a jigsaw puzzle and is soon causing mischief at the hospital. He clambers around, wakes up
woozy from his minor operation and has no interest in anything but sleeping or scooting down the hall in a run-awaywheelchair. (The wheelchair is called a go-cart; that's how long ago this was written). The illustrations are a treat whileShare This Book

<p>the text is not quite its equal. The Reys rescue it with the unexplained figure of Betsy, a little girl also at the hospital who
is very sad and very scared. Only at the finale -- when George gets into more trouble -- do we finally see her really and
laugh. Where is her family? What is she there for? Will she get better? The book's willingness to leave these questions
unanswered and their simple but effective way of tying up the pieces of the story at the end make this tale an enduringone, even after 50 years. Actor John Krazinski does an enthusiastic reading on the audio CD. It's geared towards very smallchildren and a bit over-emphatic, but fine. However, the jaunty if bland score that's included means Krazinski's performancelasts 18 minutes. Anyone reading along will soon grow impatient at the draggy pacing. So the audiobook is best appreciated
on its own, perhaps in a car ride -- and hopefully not a car ride on the way to the hospital. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
"While beginning readers are convinced that they are enjoying themselves with George, their supervising adults
are equally sure that they are learning something. Both are absolutely right." Kirkus Reviews
