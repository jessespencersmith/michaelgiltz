10/05/2004 03:10:00 AMWhat's so galling about the Bush attempt to turn Kerry's phrase"global test" into "we have to get permission from France beforeputting on our shoes in the morning" is that it's a complete lie, themedia knows it's a lie but doesn't emphasize in every discussion ofthe Bush ads, Bush comments, Bush surrogate attacks that they'renot simply twisting the words out of context but trying to pretendthat Kerry was saying the EXACT OPPOSITE of what he said.Here's the statement in full by Kerry:"The president always has the right, and always has hadthe right, for preemptive strike. That was a great doctrinethroughout the Cold War. And it was always one of thethings we argued about with respect to arms control."No president, though all of American history, has everceded, and nor would I, the right to preempt in any waynecessary to protect the United States of America."But if and when you do it, Jim, you have to do it in a waythat passes the test, that passes the global test where yourcountrymen, your people understand fully why you're doingwhat you're doing and you can prove to the world that youdid it for legitimate reasons."Here we have our own secretary of state who has had toapologize to the world for the presentation he made to theUnited Nations."In other words, Kerry explicitly says he WOULD act alone to defendAmerica's interests. But he said when you do that, you better bedamn sure you've got your facts straight and can justify yourunilateral actions to your friends and allies and the world at large.And of course that global test is exactly what Bush failed. Notbecause he did something other countries disapproved of. Butbecause his central evidence was a lie and he knew it was a lie andevery assumption he made was wrong and has been proven wrong. Ifthe US had found weapons of mass destruction or a nuclear facilitybuilding bombs only a few months away from being ready-to-go, theFrench and the Germans would have had to eat crow.Kerry says directly and without equivocation he would act unilaterally.He simply states -- quite reasonably -- you better be damn certainwhen you do so. Any newspaper or magazine or TV broadcast thatdoesn't make absolutely clear that any Bush claim "global test"means foreign approval is an out and out lie should be ashamed ofitself.
