Thanksto press invites and the such, I did it all for the grand total of $49. Whosays New York is expensive?The National at BAM *** -- I wish I liked them more, but there's nodenying this NYC band can build up a head of steam musically. I findthem more interesting melodically than lyrically and the lead singerunfortunately reminds me of the guy from Crash Test Dummies. Thecrowd loved it when he shredded his voice on some ecstatic riff.Intelligent and fun, if not overwhelming. $16 ticket. (I was in the frontrow of the THIRD level. Never been that high before at BAM but for arock show it really didn't matter.)The Strawberry New Play Festival ** 1/2 -- Six one act plays, includingone by Jack Slattery, the 16 year old son of friends I met via YankeeStadium. "Cold April" by Jack's teacher actually won Best Play. ThoughI found it a bit noble, Erica Lauren as Mosi was solid. "Rodwart'sWorld" was a so-so work about a therapist and her interfering,middle-aged son Rodwart. "An Acute Triangle" was an uninspired taleof two brothers desired by a female vampire who can't choose betweenthem enlivened somewhat by the lead actors. "Marked" was anambitious, challenging piece about an elderly woman refusing to takeher meds who is paranoid and the son trying to help her.Unfortunately, the lead female repeatedly stumbled over her lines,making it impossible to get lost in the story. "What Cheer, Iowa" wasmy favorite of the fest, a rambunctious comedy about people trapped ina waiting room hoping their cars will pass inspection. The only flawwas a secondary character wildly overacted, for which I blame thedirector who otherwise did a fine job keeping it moving. "Can CheeseDoodles Do You Harm?" was -- I'm delighted to say -- a close second inmy favorite of the plays. (It should be Cheez Doodles, by the way, Jack.)A fun broad comedy about a super fat girl trying to fit into new clothesfor the prom but accidentally popping off buttons that killed orwounded passers-by, unlike most of the other plays it actually wantedto entertain and had a game cast making the most of it. I especiallyliked the surreal touch of the Boy Scout putting a fish into the punchNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
