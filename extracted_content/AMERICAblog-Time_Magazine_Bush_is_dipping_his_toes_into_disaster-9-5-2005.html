9/05/2005 04:00:00 PMI'd say Bush dove in head first, but their commentary isblistering:It isn't easy picking George Bush's worst momentlast week. Was it his first go at addressing the crisisWednesday, when he came across as cool to the point ofuncaring? Was it when he said that he didn't "think anybodyexpected" the New Orleans levees to give way, though thatvery possibility had been forecast for years? Was it when hearrived in Mobile, Ala., a full four days after the storm madelandfall, and praised his hapless Federal EmergencyManagement Agency (FEMA) director, Michael D. Brown,whose disaster credentials seemed to consist of once beingthe commissioner of the International Arabian HorseAssociation?... And he was so slow.For good measure, here's a profile of FEMA head Michael Brown in theMiami Herald and his "unlikely background."
