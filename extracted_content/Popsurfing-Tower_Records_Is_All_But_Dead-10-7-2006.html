However, the SunsetBoulevard store is to be sold for $12 million. It's unclear to me whetherthat means it will continue under new management with the TowerRecords name. Could a similar thing happen for one or both of the NewYork stores? No other record chain comes even close to Tower Recordsin depth and quality and music-loving atmosphere. Practically the firstthing I did when I moved to New York was go to Tower Records. I hungout there for hours on end going through the piles of CDs. I even wenton a date with an employee of Tower, which is as close as I could get todating the store itself. I even love their shopping bags, which are sostrong and durable I use them (double-bagged) to cart my mail home.I'm heart-broken.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
