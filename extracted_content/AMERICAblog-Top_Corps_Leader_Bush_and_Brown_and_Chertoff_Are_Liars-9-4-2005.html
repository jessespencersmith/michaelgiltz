9/04/2005 01:25:00 PMChertoff is lying again and again on TV this morning with theridiculous, indeed insulting lie that NO ONE could haveanticipated a hurricane striking AND the levee breaking.Reporters should jump down their throats when they say it. Hegot off scott free on "Face The Nation," unfortunately, eventhough there are dozens of documented examples on thiswebsite alone not to mention simple common sense provinghim wrong. No one anticipated a hurricane striking and thelevee breaking at the same time? EVERYONE anticipated that.The latest proof Chertoff and Bush and Brown are lying, thisfrom the LA Times:Lt. Gen. Carl Strock, the [Army Corp of Engineers]commander, conceded Friday that the government hadknown the New Orleans levees could never withstanda hurricane higher than a Category 3. Corps officialsshuddered, he said, when they realized that Katrina wasbarreling down on the Gulf Coast with the vastly greaterdestructive force of a Category 5 — the strongest type ofhurricane. Washington, he said, had rolled the dice.
