8/16/2004 11:09:00 AMWell, no. But the man who thinks creationism is a valid scientifictheory and that the jury is still out on evolution continues his assaulton science. In the second in a series of articles about this, theWashington Post details dead-of-night regulatory changes thatpoliticize oversight on scientific findings and thus endanger publicsafety. How? Bush made it easier for big business to fight regulatorychanges that could cost them money by attacking valid scientificfindings. The major example here? A pesticide that "castrates" frogsaccording to numerous independent studies (including one funded bythe industry itself that they suppressed). Lengthy and filled withinteresting detail, the article has this neat summary of Bush's attackson good science:"Environmental and consumer groups say the Data Quality Act fitsinto a larger Bush administration agenda. In the past six months,more than 4,000 scientists, including dozens of Nobel laureates and11 winners of the National Medal of Science, have signed statementsaccusing the administration of politicizing science."The White House's heavy editing of a key global-warming report, itsefforts to emphasize abstinence rather than condoms in the waragainst AIDS and its alleged stacking of scientific advisorycommittees have drawn particular ire. But many scientists and publicadvocates believe that far more is at stake with the Data Quality Act."From their perspective, the act is shifting the authority over thenation's science into the politicized environment of the OMB -- achange, they say, that will favor big business."
