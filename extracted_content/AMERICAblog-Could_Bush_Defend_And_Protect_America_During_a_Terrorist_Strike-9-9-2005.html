9/09/2005 09:18:00 PMBrian Williams of NBC has a good online diary. John belowhighlighted Williams writing about the crackdown on the media:Bush couldn't control the looters or save lives, but he can sureas hell try and keep the media from showing the human deathtoll. Scroll down to Sept. 7 at 11:22 am and you find WhiteHouse Correspondent David Gregory writing this:Even more frightening is the question on every American'smind: Could the government handle a massive terrorstrike — the kind that Vice President Cheney andothers warn us about?We already have the answer. The next disaster has already struck andBush has failed spectacularly. Could Bush handle a massive terrorstrike? Of course not. Just look at New Orleans.
