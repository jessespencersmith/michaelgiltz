Shrek 2 
** DreamWorks, $29.99 
Except for Puss in Boots 
(amusingly voiced by 
Antonio Banderas), this is 
just a series of obvious gags 
and pop cultural references. 
That'~ a minority opinion, of 
course, since "Shrek 2" 
enjoyed critical acclaim and 
huge box office. Extras 
include an "American Idol" 
spoof. You're better off with 
the hilarious. timeless 
"Looney Tunes Golden 
Collection Volume Two" 
(Warner Bros., $64.92). with 
60 cartoons including Bugs 
Bunny in "What's Opera. 
Doc?" 
Star'n'ekThe 
Original Series: 
Season Two *** 1/, Paramount, $129.99 
Packaged in a cool tricorder­
shaped box, "Star Trek" is 
rather awkward to handle 
with a loose booklet that 
keeps falling out and the 
discs in an inconvenient case. 
Thank God the shows are 
worth the trouble, with Kirk 
fighting Spock in "Amok 
Time" and the comic high 
point "The Trouble With 
Tribbles." Extras include pro­
files of Leonard Nimoy and 
Nichelle Nichols. Pee-wee's 
Playhouse 
Christmas 
Special *** 1/ Image, $14.99 
Despite your feel· 
ings about his per­
sonallitc, anyone 
wi th an anarchic 
sensibility should 
love Pee-wee 
Herman This sub· 
versive ]988 
Christmas special -
with guests like 
Charo. Cher, Little 
Richard and GraCf 
Jone~ -is a delight 
fOJ fans But it',· jusf

wee'" TV series. 
Dr. Strangelove/ 
The Rapture **** each Columbia TriStar/New Line; 
$34.95/$19.97 
Two classics 
about the end 
of the world. 
"Strangelove" 
is director 
Stanley 
Kubrick's 
black-humored 
look at mutual· 
ly assured destruction from 
1963, with Peter Sellers (and 
George C. Scott!! never fun­
nier. "The Rapture" (1991) is 
far less known - a sober, 
thrilling drama about a hedo­
nistic woman (Mimi Rogers) 
who joins a cult that believes 
the end times are nigh. An 
unforgettable finale. 
Fire Within: 
Cirque Du Soleil 
*** Columbia TriStar, $39.95 '----- -
For all the brickbat~ realit~ 
shows endure, it's a genre that 
also produces top-notch TV. 
This solid, Emmy-winning 
series is a fine example. It fol­
lows young performers trying 
to break into the physically 
demanding troupe Cirque Du 
Soleil and create unique 
stunts for a new show. For a 
different type of circus, check 
out "The Simple Life 2: Road 
Trip" (Fox, $19.98).</p>
