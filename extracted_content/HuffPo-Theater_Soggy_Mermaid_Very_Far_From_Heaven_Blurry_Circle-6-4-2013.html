DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.
0:00 / 2:12
O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)
0:00 / 0:00
The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)? I won't be sure about TheCaucasian Chalk Circle until I see it again.THE THEATER OF 2013 (on a four star scale)The Other Place ** 1/2Picnic * 1/2Opus No. 7 ** 1/2Deceit * 1/2Life And Times Episodes 1-4 **Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (w Scarlett Johansson) * 1/2The Jammer ***Blood Play ** 1/2Manilow On Broadway ** 1/2Women Of Will ** 1/2All In The Timing ***Isaac's Eye ***Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale Of Musical Mystery ** 1/2The Mnemonist Of Dutchess County * 1/2Much Ado About Nothing ***Really Really *Parsifal at the Met *** 1/2The Madrid * 1/2The Wild Bride at St. Ann's ** 1/2Passion at CSC *** 1/2Carousel at Lincoln Center ***The Revisionist **Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella ***Rock Of Ages * 1/2Ann ** 1/2Old Hats ***The Flick ***Detroit '67 ** 1/2Howling Hilda reading * (Mary Testa ***)Hit The Wall *Breakfast At Tiffany's * 1/2The Mound Builders at Signature *Vanya And Sonia And Masha And Spike *** 1/2Cirque Du Soleil's Totem ***The Lying Lesson * 1/2Hands On A Hardbody *Kinky Boots **Matilda The Musical *** 1/2The Rascals: Once Upon A Dream ***Motown: The Musical **La Ruta ** 1/2The Big Knife *The Nance ***The Assembled Parties ** 1/2Jekyll & Hyde * 1/2Thoroughly Modern Millie ** 1/2Macbeth w Alan Cumming *Orphans ** 1/2The Testament Of Mary ** 1/2The Drawer Boy **The Trip To Bountiful ***I'll Eat You Last ** 1/2Pippin *This Side Of Neverland ***A Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney ***Natasha, Pierre And The Great Comet Of 1812 ***Colin Quinn Unconstitutional ** 1/2A Family For All Occasions *The Weir *** 1/2Disney's The Little Mermaid **Far From Heaven **The Caucasian Chalk Circle **Thanks for reading.

On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.

O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)
0:00 / 0:00
The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)? I won't be sure about TheCaucasian Chalk Circle until I see it again.THE THEATER OF 2013 (on a four star scale)The Other Place ** 1/2Picnic * 1/2Opus No. 7 ** 1/2Deceit * 1/2Life And Times Episodes 1-4 **Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (w Scarlett Johansson) * 1/2The Jammer ***Blood Play ** 1/2Manilow On Broadway ** 1/2Women Of Will ** 1/2All In The Timing ***Isaac's Eye ***Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale Of Musical Mystery ** 1/2The Mnemonist Of Dutchess County * 1/2Much Ado About Nothing ***Really Really *Parsifal at the Met *** 1/2The Madrid * 1/2The Wild Bride at St. Ann's ** 1/2Passion at CSC *** 1/2Carousel at Lincoln Center ***The Revisionist **Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella ***Rock Of Ages * 1/2Ann ** 1/2Old Hats ***The Flick ***Detroit '67 ** 1/2Howling Hilda reading * (Mary Testa ***)Hit The Wall *Breakfast At Tiffany's * 1/2The Mound Builders at Signature *Vanya And Sonia And Masha And Spike *** 1/2Cirque Du Soleil's Totem ***The Lying Lesson * 1/2Hands On A Hardbody *Kinky Boots **Matilda The Musical *** 1/2The Rascals: Once Upon A Dream ***Motown: The Musical **La Ruta ** 1/2The Big Knife *The Nance ***The Assembled Parties ** 1/2Jekyll & Hyde * 1/2Thoroughly Modern Millie ** 1/2Macbeth w Alan Cumming *Orphans ** 1/2The Testament Of Mary ** 1/2The Drawer Boy **The Trip To Bountiful ***I'll Eat You Last ** 1/2Pippin *This Side Of Neverland ***A Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney ***Natasha, Pierre And The Great Comet Of 1812 ***Colin Quinn Unconstitutional ** 1/2A Family For All Occasions *The Weir *** 1/2Disney's The Little Mermaid **Far From Heaven **The Caucasian Chalk Circle **Thanks for reading.

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume.

That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)

The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)?

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.
0:00 / 2:12
O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera.

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.
0:00 / 2:12
O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)
0:00 / 0:00
The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)? I won't be sure about TheCaucasian Chalk Circle until I see it again.THE THEATER OF 2013 (on a four star scale)The Other Place ** 1/2Picnic * 1/2Opus No. 7 ** 1/2Deceit * 1/2Life And Times Episodes 1-4 **Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (w Scarlett Johansson) * 1/2The Jammer ***Blood Play ** 1/2Manilow On Broadway ** 1/2Women Of Will ** 1/2All In The Timing ***Isaac's Eye ***Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale Of Musical Mystery ** 1/2The Mnemonist Of Dutchess County * 1/2Much Ado About Nothing ***Really Really *Parsifal at the Met *** 1/2The Madrid * 1/2The Wild Bride at St. Ann's ** 1/2Passion at CSC *** 1/2Carousel at Lincoln Center ***The Revisionist **Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella ***Rock Of Ages * 1/2Ann ** 1/2Old Hats ***The Flick ***Detroit '67 ** 1/2Howling Hilda reading * (Mary Testa ***)Hit The Wall *Breakfast At Tiffany's * 1/2The Mound Builders at Signature *Vanya And Sonia And Masha And Spike *** 1/2Cirque Du Soleil's Totem ***The Lying Lesson * 1/2Hands On A Hardbody *Kinky Boots **Matilda The Musical *** 1/2The Rascals: Once Upon A Dream ***Motown: The Musical **La Ruta ** 1/2The Big Knife *The Nance ***The Assembled Parties ** 1/2Jekyll & Hyde * 1/2Thoroughly Modern Millie ** 1/2Macbeth w Alan Cumming *Orphans ** 1/2The Testament Of Mary ** 1/2The Drawer Boy **The Trip To Bountiful ***I'll Eat You Last ** 1/2Pippin *This Side Of Neverland ***A Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney ***Natasha, Pierre And The Great Comet Of 1812 ***Colin Quinn Unconstitutional ** 1/2A Family For All Occasions *The Weir *** 1/2Disney's The Little Mermaid **Far From Heaven **The Caucasian Chalk Circle **Thanks for reading.

And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.

O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)
0:00 / 0:00
The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)? I won't be sure about TheCaucasian Chalk Circle until I see it again.THE THEATER OF 2013 (on a four star scale)The Other Place ** 1/2Picnic * 1/2Opus No. 7 ** 1/2Deceit * 1/2Life And Times Episodes 1-4 **Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (w Scarlett Johansson) * 1/2The Jammer ***Blood Play ** 1/2Manilow On Broadway ** 1/2Women Of Will ** 1/2All In The Timing ***Isaac's Eye ***Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale Of Musical Mystery ** 1/2The Mnemonist Of Dutchess County * 1/2Much Ado About Nothing ***Really Really *Parsifal at the Met *** 1/2The Madrid * 1/2The Wild Bride at St. Ann's ** 1/2Passion at CSC *** 1/2Carousel at Lincoln Center ***The Revisionist **Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella ***Rock Of Ages * 1/2Ann ** 1/2Old Hats ***The Flick ***Detroit '67 ** 1/2Howling Hilda reading * (Mary Testa ***)Hit The Wall *Breakfast At Tiffany's * 1/2The Mound Builders at Signature *Vanya And Sonia And Masha And Spike *** 1/2Cirque Du Soleil's Totem ***The Lying Lesson * 1/2Hands On A Hardbody *Kinky Boots **Matilda The Musical *** 1/2The Rascals: Once Upon A Dream ***Motown: The Musical **La Ruta ** 1/2The Big Knife *The Nance ***The Assembled Parties ** 1/2Jekyll & Hyde * 1/2Thoroughly Modern Millie ** 1/2Macbeth w Alan Cumming *Orphans ** 1/2The Testament Of Mary ** 1/2The Drawer Boy **The Trip To Bountiful ***I'll Eat You Last ** 1/2Pippin *This Side Of Neverland ***A Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney ***Natasha, Pierre And The Great Comet Of 1812 ***Colin Quinn Unconstitutional ** 1/2A Family For All Occasions *The Weir *** 1/2Disney's The Little Mermaid **Far From Heaven **The Caucasian Chalk Circle **Thanks for reading.

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume.

Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)

The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)?

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.
0:00 / 2:12
O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)

Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there.

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.
0:00 / 2:12
O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)
0:00 / 0:00
The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)? I won't be sure about TheCaucasian Chalk Circle until I see it again.THE THEATER OF 2013 (on a four star scale)The Other Place ** 1/2Picnic * 1/2Opus No. 7 ** 1/2Deceit * 1/2Life And Times Episodes 1-4 **Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (w Scarlett Johansson) * 1/2The Jammer ***Blood Play ** 1/2Manilow On Broadway ** 1/2Women Of Will ** 1/2All In The Timing ***Isaac's Eye ***Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale Of Musical Mystery ** 1/2The Mnemonist Of Dutchess County * 1/2Much Ado About Nothing ***Really Really *Parsifal at the Met *** 1/2The Madrid * 1/2The Wild Bride at St. Ann's ** 1/2Passion at CSC *** 1/2Carousel at Lincoln Center ***The Revisionist **Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella ***Rock Of Ages * 1/2Ann ** 1/2Old Hats ***The Flick ***Detroit '67 ** 1/2Howling Hilda reading * (Mary Testa ***)Hit The Wall *Breakfast At Tiffany's * 1/2The Mound Builders at Signature *Vanya And Sonia And Masha And Spike *** 1/2Cirque Du Soleil's Totem ***The Lying Lesson * 1/2Hands On A Hardbody *Kinky Boots **Matilda The Musical *** 1/2The Rascals: Once Upon A Dream ***Motown: The Musical **La Ruta ** 1/2The Big Knife *The Nance ***The Assembled Parties ** 1/2Jekyll & Hyde * 1/2Thoroughly Modern Millie ** 1/2Macbeth w Alan Cumming *Orphans ** 1/2The Testament Of Mary ** 1/2The Drawer Boy **The Trip To Bountiful ***I'll Eat You Last ** 1/2Pippin *This Side Of Neverland ***A Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney ***Natasha, Pierre And The Great Comet Of 1812 ***Colin Quinn Unconstitutional ** 1/2A Family For All Occasions *The Weir *** 1/2Disney's The Little Mermaid **Far From Heaven **The Caucasian Chalk Circle **Thanks for reading.

Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.

O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)
0:00 / 0:00
The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)? I won't be sure about TheCaucasian Chalk Circle until I see it again.THE THEATER OF 2013 (on a four star scale)The Other Place ** 1/2Picnic * 1/2Opus No. 7 ** 1/2Deceit * 1/2Life And Times Episodes 1-4 **Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (w Scarlett Johansson) * 1/2The Jammer ***Blood Play ** 1/2Manilow On Broadway ** 1/2Women Of Will ** 1/2All In The Timing ***Isaac's Eye ***Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale Of Musical Mystery ** 1/2The Mnemonist Of Dutchess County * 1/2Much Ado About Nothing ***Really Really *Parsifal at the Met *** 1/2The Madrid * 1/2The Wild Bride at St. Ann's ** 1/2Passion at CSC *** 1/2Carousel at Lincoln Center ***The Revisionist **Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella ***Rock Of Ages * 1/2Ann ** 1/2Old Hats ***The Flick ***Detroit '67 ** 1/2Howling Hilda reading * (Mary Testa ***)Hit The Wall *Breakfast At Tiffany's * 1/2The Mound Builders at Signature *Vanya And Sonia And Masha And Spike *** 1/2Cirque Du Soleil's Totem ***The Lying Lesson * 1/2Hands On A Hardbody *Kinky Boots **Matilda The Musical *** 1/2The Rascals: Once Upon A Dream ***Motown: The Musical **La Ruta ** 1/2The Big Knife *The Nance ***The Assembled Parties ** 1/2Jekyll & Hyde * 1/2Thoroughly Modern Millie ** 1/2Macbeth w Alan Cumming *Orphans ** 1/2The Testament Of Mary ** 1/2The Drawer Boy **The Trip To Bountiful ***I'll Eat You Last ** 1/2Pippin *This Side Of Neverland ***A Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney ***Natasha, Pierre And The Great Comet Of 1812 ***Colin Quinn Unconstitutional ** 1/2A Family For All Occasions *The Weir *** 1/2Disney's The Little Mermaid **Far From Heaven **The Caucasian Chalk Circle **Thanks for reading.

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded.

But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)?

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.
0:00 / 2:12
O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)
0:00 / 0:00
The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.)

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.
0:00 / 2:12
O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)
0:00 / 0:00
The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)? I won't be sure about TheCaucasian Chalk Circle until I see it again.THE THEATER OF 2013 (on a four star scale)The Other Place ** 1/2Picnic * 1/2Opus No. 7 ** 1/2Deceit * 1/2Life And Times Episodes 1-4 **Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (w Scarlett Johansson) * 1/2The Jammer ***Blood Play ** 1/2Manilow On Broadway ** 1/2Women Of Will ** 1/2All In The Timing ***Isaac's Eye ***Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale Of Musical Mystery ** 1/2The Mnemonist Of Dutchess County * 1/2Much Ado About Nothing ***Really Really *Parsifal at the Met *** 1/2The Madrid * 1/2The Wild Bride at St. Ann's ** 1/2Passion at CSC *** 1/2Carousel at Lincoln Center ***The Revisionist **Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella ***Rock Of Ages * 1/2Ann ** 1/2Old Hats ***The Flick ***Detroit '67 ** 1/2Howling Hilda reading * (Mary Testa ***)Hit The Wall *Breakfast At Tiffany's * 1/2The Mound Builders at Signature *Vanya And Sonia And Masha And Spike *** 1/2Cirque Du Soleil's Totem ***The Lying Lesson * 1/2Hands On A Hardbody *Kinky Boots **Matilda The Musical *** 1/2The Rascals: Once Upon A Dream ***Motown: The Musical **La Ruta ** 1/2The Big Knife *The Nance ***The Assembled Parties ** 1/2Jekyll & Hyde * 1/2Thoroughly Modern Millie ** 1/2Macbeth w Alan Cumming *Orphans ** 1/2The Testament Of Mary ** 1/2The Drawer Boy **The Trip To Bountiful ***I'll Eat You Last ** 1/2Pippin *This Side Of Neverland ***A Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney ***Natasha, Pierre And The Great Comet Of 1812 ***Colin Quinn Unconstitutional ** 1/2A Family For All Occasions *The Weir *** 1/2Disney's The Little Mermaid **Far From Heaven **The Caucasian Chalk Circle **Thanks for reading.

Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.

O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)
0:00 / 0:00
The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)? I won't be sure about TheCaucasian Chalk Circle until I see it again.THE THEATER OF 2013 (on a four star scale)The Other Place ** 1/2Picnic * 1/2Opus No. 7 ** 1/2Deceit * 1/2Life And Times Episodes 1-4 **Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (w Scarlett Johansson) * 1/2The Jammer ***Blood Play ** 1/2Manilow On Broadway ** 1/2Women Of Will ** 1/2All In The Timing ***Isaac's Eye ***Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale Of Musical Mystery ** 1/2The Mnemonist Of Dutchess County * 1/2Much Ado About Nothing ***Really Really *Parsifal at the Met *** 1/2The Madrid * 1/2The Wild Bride at St. Ann's ** 1/2Passion at CSC *** 1/2Carousel at Lincoln Center ***The Revisionist **Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella ***Rock Of Ages * 1/2Ann ** 1/2Old Hats ***The Flick ***Detroit '67 ** 1/2Howling Hilda reading * (Mary Testa ***)Hit The Wall *Breakfast At Tiffany's * 1/2The Mound Builders at Signature *Vanya And Sonia And Masha And Spike *** 1/2Cirque Du Soleil's Totem ***The Lying Lesson * 1/2Hands On A Hardbody *Kinky Boots **Matilda The Musical *** 1/2The Rascals: Once Upon A Dream ***Motown: The Musical **La Ruta ** 1/2The Big Knife *The Nance ***The Assembled Parties ** 1/2Jekyll & Hyde * 1/2Thoroughly Modern Millie ** 1/2Macbeth w Alan Cumming *Orphans ** 1/2The Testament Of Mary ** 1/2The Drawer Boy **The Trip To Bountiful ***I'll Eat You Last ** 1/2Pippin *This Side Of Neverland ***A Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney ***Natasha, Pierre And The Great Comet Of 1812 ***Colin Quinn Unconstitutional ** 1/2A Family For All Occasions *The Weir *** 1/2Disney's The Little Mermaid **Far From Heaven **The Caucasian Chalk Circle **Thanks for reading.

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical.

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.
0:00 / 2:12
O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)
0:00 / 0:00
The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)? I won't be sure about TheCaucasian Chalk Circle until I see it again.THE THEATER OF 2013 (on a four star scale)The Other Place ** 1/2Picnic * 1/2Opus No. 7 ** 1/2Deceit * 1/2Life And Times Episodes 1-4 **Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (w Scarlett Johansson) * 1/2The Jammer ***Blood Play ** 1/2Manilow On Broadway ** 1/2Women Of Will ** 1/2All In The Timing ***Isaac's Eye ***Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale Of Musical Mystery ** 1/2The Mnemonist Of Dutchess County * 1/2Much Ado About Nothing ***Really Really *Parsifal at the Met *** 1/2The Madrid * 1/2The Wild Bride at St. Ann's ** 1/2Passion at CSC *** 1/2Carousel at Lincoln Center ***The Revisionist **Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella ***Rock Of Ages * 1/2Ann ** 1/2Old Hats ***The Flick ***Detroit '67 ** 1/2Howling Hilda reading * (Mary Testa ***)Hit The Wall *Breakfast At Tiffany's * 1/2The Mound Builders at Signature *Vanya And Sonia And Masha And Spike *** 1/2Cirque Du Soleil's Totem ***The Lying Lesson * 1/2Hands On A Hardbody *Kinky Boots **Matilda The Musical *** 1/2The Rascals: Once Upon A Dream ***Motown: The Musical **La Ruta ** 1/2The Big Knife *The Nance ***The Assembled Parties ** 1/2Jekyll & Hyde * 1/2Thoroughly Modern Millie ** 1/2Macbeth w Alan Cumming *Orphans ** 1/2The Testament Of Mary ** 1/2The Drawer Boy **The Trip To Bountiful ***I'll Eat You Last ** 1/2Pippin *This Side Of Neverland ***A Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney ***Natasha, Pierre And The Great Comet Of 1812 ***Colin Quinn Unconstitutional ** 1/2A Family For All Occasions *The Weir *** 1/2Disney's The Little Mermaid **Far From Heaven **The Caucasian Chalk Circle **Thanks for reading.

But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.
0:00 / 2:12
O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)
0:00 / 0:00
The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)? I won't be sure about TheCaucasian Chalk Circle until I see it again.THE THEATER OF 2013 (on a four star scale)The Other Place ** 1/2Picnic * 1/2Opus No. 7 ** 1/2Deceit * 1/2Life And Times Episodes 1-4 **Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (w Scarlett Johansson) * 1/2The Jammer ***Blood Play ** 1/2Manilow On Broadway ** 1/2Women Of Will ** 1/2All In The Timing ***Isaac's Eye ***Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale Of Musical Mystery ** 1/2The Mnemonist Of Dutchess County * 1/2Much Ado About Nothing ***Really Really *Parsifal at the Met *** 1/2The Madrid * 1/2The Wild Bride at St. Ann's ** 1/2Passion at CSC *** 1/2Carousel at Lincoln Center ***The Revisionist **Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella ***Rock Of Ages * 1/2Ann ** 1/2Old Hats ***The Flick ***Detroit '67 ** 1/2Howling Hilda reading * (Mary Testa ***)Hit The Wall *Breakfast At Tiffany's * 1/2The Mound Builders at Signature *Vanya And Sonia And Masha And Spike *** 1/2Cirque Du Soleil's Totem ***The Lying Lesson * 1/2Hands On A Hardbody *Kinky Boots **Matilda The Musical *** 1/2The Rascals: Once Upon A Dream ***Motown: The Musical **La Ruta ** 1/2The Big Knife *The Nance ***The Assembled Parties ** 1/2Jekyll & Hyde * 1/2Thoroughly Modern Millie ** 1/2Macbeth w Alan Cumming *Orphans ** 1/2The Testament Of Mary ** 1/2The Drawer Boy **The Trip To Bountiful ***I'll Eat You Last ** 1/2Pippin *This Side Of Neverland ***A Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney ***Natasha, Pierre And The Great Comet Of 1812 ***Colin Quinn Unconstitutional ** 1/2A Family For All Occasions *The Weir *** 1/2Disney's The Little Mermaid **Far From Heaven **The Caucasian Chalk Circle **Thanks for reading.

The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.

O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)

The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)?

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom.

Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special.

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.
0:00 / 2:12
O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)
0:00 / 0:00
The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)? I won't be sure about TheCaucasian Chalk Circle until I see it again.THE THEATER OF 2013 (on a four star scale)The Other Place ** 1/2Picnic * 1/2Opus No. 7 ** 1/2Deceit * 1/2Life And Times Episodes 1-4 **Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (w Scarlett Johansson) * 1/2The Jammer ***Blood Play ** 1/2Manilow On Broadway ** 1/2Women Of Will ** 1/2All In The Timing ***Isaac's Eye ***Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale Of Musical Mystery ** 1/2The Mnemonist Of Dutchess County * 1/2Much Ado About Nothing ***Really Really *Parsifal at the Met *** 1/2The Madrid * 1/2The Wild Bride at St. Ann's ** 1/2Passion at CSC *** 1/2Carousel at Lincoln Center ***The Revisionist **Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella ***Rock Of Ages * 1/2Ann ** 1/2Old Hats ***The Flick ***Detroit '67 ** 1/2Howling Hilda reading * (Mary Testa ***)Hit The Wall *Breakfast At Tiffany's * 1/2The Mound Builders at Signature *Vanya And Sonia And Masha And Spike *** 1/2Cirque Du Soleil's Totem ***The Lying Lesson * 1/2Hands On A Hardbody *Kinky Boots **Matilda The Musical *** 1/2The Rascals: Once Upon A Dream ***Motown: The Musical **La Ruta ** 1/2The Big Knife *The Nance ***The Assembled Parties ** 1/2Jekyll & Hyde * 1/2Thoroughly Modern Millie ** 1/2Macbeth w Alan Cumming *Orphans ** 1/2The Testament Of Mary ** 1/2The Drawer Boy **The Trip To Bountiful ***I'll Eat You Last ** 1/2Pippin *This Side Of Neverland ***A Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney ***Natasha, Pierre And The Great Comet Of 1812 ***Colin Quinn Unconstitutional ** 1/2A Family For All Occasions *The Weir *** 1/2Disney's The Little Mermaid **Far From Heaven **The Caucasian Chalk Circle **Thanks for reading.

They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.
0:00 / 2:12
O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)
0:00 / 0:00
The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)? I won't be sure about TheCaucasian Chalk Circle until I see it again.THE THEATER OF 2013 (on a four star scale)The Other Place ** 1/2Picnic * 1/2Opus No. 7 ** 1/2Deceit * 1/2Life And Times Episodes 1-4 **Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (w Scarlett Johansson) * 1/2The Jammer ***Blood Play ** 1/2Manilow On Broadway ** 1/2Women Of Will ** 1/2All In The Timing ***Isaac's Eye ***Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale Of Musical Mystery ** 1/2The Mnemonist Of Dutchess County * 1/2Much Ado About Nothing ***Really Really *Parsifal at the Met *** 1/2The Madrid * 1/2The Wild Bride at St. Ann's ** 1/2Passion at CSC *** 1/2Carousel at Lincoln Center ***The Revisionist **Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella ***Rock Of Ages * 1/2Ann ** 1/2Old Hats ***The Flick ***Detroit '67 ** 1/2Howling Hilda reading * (Mary Testa ***)Hit The Wall *Breakfast At Tiffany's * 1/2The Mound Builders at Signature *Vanya And Sonia And Masha And Spike *** 1/2Cirque Du Soleil's Totem ***The Lying Lesson * 1/2Hands On A Hardbody *Kinky Boots **Matilda The Musical *** 1/2The Rascals: Once Upon A Dream ***Motown: The Musical **La Ruta ** 1/2The Big Knife *The Nance ***The Assembled Parties ** 1/2Jekyll & Hyde * 1/2Thoroughly Modern Millie ** 1/2Macbeth w Alan Cumming *Orphans ** 1/2The Testament Of Mary ** 1/2The Drawer Boy **The Trip To Bountiful ***I'll Eat You Last ** 1/2Pippin *This Side Of Neverland ***A Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney ***Natasha, Pierre And The Great Comet Of 1812 ***Colin Quinn Unconstitutional ** 1/2A Family For All Occasions *The Weir *** 1/2Disney's The Little Mermaid **Far From Heaven **The Caucasian Chalk Circle **Thanks for reading.

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film.

But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama.

Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.

O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)

The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)?

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special.

But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama.

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.
0:00 / 2:12
O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)
0:00 / 0:00
The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)? I won't be sure about TheCaucasian Chalk Circle until I see it again.THE THEATER OF 2013 (on a four star scale)The Other Place ** 1/2Picnic * 1/2Opus No. 7 ** 1/2Deceit * 1/2Life And Times Episodes 1-4 **Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (w Scarlett Johansson) * 1/2The Jammer ***Blood Play ** 1/2Manilow On Broadway ** 1/2Women Of Will ** 1/2All In The Timing ***Isaac's Eye ***Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale Of Musical Mystery ** 1/2The Mnemonist Of Dutchess County * 1/2Much Ado About Nothing ***Really Really *Parsifal at the Met *** 1/2The Madrid * 1/2The Wild Bride at St. Ann's ** 1/2Passion at CSC *** 1/2Carousel at Lincoln Center ***The Revisionist **Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella ***Rock Of Ages * 1/2Ann ** 1/2Old Hats ***The Flick ***Detroit '67 ** 1/2Howling Hilda reading * (Mary Testa ***)Hit The Wall *Breakfast At Tiffany's * 1/2The Mound Builders at Signature *Vanya And Sonia And Masha And Spike *** 1/2Cirque Du Soleil's Totem ***The Lying Lesson * 1/2Hands On A Hardbody *Kinky Boots **Matilda The Musical *** 1/2The Rascals: Once Upon A Dream ***Motown: The Musical **La Ruta ** 1/2The Big Knife *The Nance ***The Assembled Parties ** 1/2Jekyll & Hyde * 1/2Thoroughly Modern Millie ** 1/2Macbeth w Alan Cumming *Orphans ** 1/2The Testament Of Mary ** 1/2The Drawer Boy **The Trip To Bountiful ***I'll Eat You Last ** 1/2Pippin *This Side Of Neverland ***A Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney ***Natasha, Pierre And The Great Comet Of 1812 ***Colin Quinn Unconstitutional ** 1/2A Family For All Occasions *The Weir *** 1/2Disney's The Little Mermaid **Far From Heaven **The Caucasian Chalk Circle **Thanks for reading.

They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.
0:00 / 2:12
O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)
0:00 / 0:00
The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)? I won't be sure about TheCaucasian Chalk Circle until I see it again.THE THEATER OF 2013 (on a four star scale)The Other Place ** 1/2Picnic * 1/2Opus No. 7 ** 1/2Deceit * 1/2Life And Times Episodes 1-4 **Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (w Scarlett Johansson) * 1/2The Jammer ***Blood Play ** 1/2Manilow On Broadway ** 1/2Women Of Will ** 1/2All In The Timing ***Isaac's Eye ***Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale Of Musical Mystery ** 1/2The Mnemonist Of Dutchess County * 1/2Much Ado About Nothing ***Really Really *Parsifal at the Met *** 1/2The Madrid * 1/2The Wild Bride at St. Ann's ** 1/2Passion at CSC *** 1/2Carousel at Lincoln Center ***The Revisionist **Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella ***Rock Of Ages * 1/2Ann ** 1/2Old Hats ***The Flick ***Detroit '67 ** 1/2Howling Hilda reading * (Mary Testa ***)Hit The Wall *Breakfast At Tiffany's * 1/2The Mound Builders at Signature *Vanya And Sonia And Masha And Spike *** 1/2Cirque Du Soleil's Totem ***The Lying Lesson * 1/2Hands On A Hardbody *Kinky Boots **Matilda The Musical *** 1/2The Rascals: Once Upon A Dream ***Motown: The Musical **La Ruta ** 1/2The Big Knife *The Nance ***The Assembled Parties ** 1/2Jekyll & Hyde * 1/2Thoroughly Modern Millie ** 1/2Macbeth w Alan Cumming *Orphans ** 1/2The Testament Of Mary ** 1/2The Drawer Boy **The Trip To Bountiful ***I'll Eat You Last ** 1/2Pippin *This Side Of Neverland ***A Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney ***Natasha, Pierre And The Great Comet Of 1812 ***Colin Quinn Unconstitutional ** 1/2A Family For All Occasions *The Weir *** 1/2Disney's The Little Mermaid **Far From Heaven **The Caucasian Chalk Circle **Thanks for reading.

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film.

But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama.

Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.

O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)

The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)?

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special.

But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama.

DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **FAR FROM HEAVEN **THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **DISNEY'S THE LITTLE MERMAID **PAPER MILL PLAYHOUSETurning a classic animated film into a stage musical isn't easy, especially when the setting isunderwater and your stars include mermaids with fins, fish, crabs and seagulls. But TheLittle Mermaid is the movie that pushed the Disney creative and commercial revival intooverdrive thanks to great animation and the songwriting team of Ashman and Menken, ateam that would prove one of the best partnerships the musical ever had. It's easy to see whythey brought it to Broadway: when you're starting with a handful of show-stoppers like"Under The Sea," "Kiss the Girl," "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and "Part Of Your World," thebattle's half won, isn't it?That version ran for two years but was generally found wanting compared to the film. It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.
0:00 / 2:12
O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)
0:00 / 0:00
The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)? I won't be sure about TheCaucasian Chalk Circle until I see it again.THE THEATER OF 2013 (on a four star scale)The Other Place ** 1/2Picnic * 1/2Opus No. 7 ** 1/2Deceit * 1/2Life And Times Episodes 1-4 **Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (w Scarlett Johansson) * 1/2The Jammer ***Blood Play ** 1/2Manilow On Broadway ** 1/2Women Of Will ** 1/2All In The Timing ***Isaac's Eye ***Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale Of Musical Mystery ** 1/2The Mnemonist Of Dutchess County * 1/2Much Ado About Nothing ***Really Really *Parsifal at the Met *** 1/2The Madrid * 1/2The Wild Bride at St. Ann's ** 1/2Passion at CSC *** 1/2Carousel at Lincoln Center ***The Revisionist **Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella ***Rock Of Ages * 1/2Ann ** 1/2Old Hats ***The Flick ***Detroit '67 ** 1/2Howling Hilda reading * (Mary Testa ***)Hit The Wall *Breakfast At Tiffany's * 1/2The Mound Builders at Signature *Vanya And Sonia And Masha And Spike *** 1/2Cirque Du Soleil's Totem ***The Lying Lesson * 1/2Hands On A Hardbody *Kinky Boots **Matilda The Musical *** 1/2The Rascals: Once Upon A Dream ***Motown: The Musical **La Ruta ** 1/2The Big Knife *The Nance ***The Assembled Parties ** 1/2Jekyll & Hyde * 1/2Thoroughly Modern Millie ** 1/2Macbeth w Alan Cumming *Orphans ** 1/2The Testament Of Mary ** 1/2The Drawer Boy **The Trip To Bountiful ***I'll Eat You Last ** 1/2Pippin *This Side Of Neverland ***A Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney ***Natasha, Pierre And The Great Comet Of 1812 ***Colin Quinn Unconstitutional ** 1/2A Family For All Occasions *The Weir *** 1/2Disney's The Little Mermaid **Far From Heaven **The Caucasian Chalk Circle **Thanks for reading.

It'sbeen tweaked for Europe and high school productions and now it's been reworked and re-imagined (or is that re-imagineered?) for this revival at Paper Mill Playhouse. They had ahuge success with Newsies which went straight to a smash run on Broadway. Not this time.The biggest challenge facing this story is how to bring to life undersea creatures. The firststage production apparently relied heavily on wheelies (those shoes with wheels built in) soactors could float around the stage. Those are saved here for two minor characters. Instead,they've made the bizarre decision to have the actors...undulate while standing around togive the illusion of being fish and mermaids and so on. "Undulate" is about the only way Ican describe this very distracting, even laughter-inducing choice. (I kept thinking of PatrickDuffy swimming underwater as The Man From Atlantis in a cheesy 1970s drama.) Godbless the poor actors who have to keep rolling their stomachs in and out while swaying sideto side and deliver their lines and/or burst into song. Surely a less literal choice would havesufficed, even something as simple as a one foot high screen of "bubbles" or a literalaquarium of water with their lower legs obscured behind it to draw attention away fromtheir feet. Clearly it's a key issue with the show and only a desperate willingness to choosesomething, anything to create the illusion of underwater life convinced everyone thisundulating was a good idea. It's simply impossible to take the show seriously when theundulating goes on the entire night.
0:00 / 3:45
Unfortunately, the problems don't end there for this show directed by Glenn Casale. Thebeloved version delivered by the film and recreated here is about Ariel, a mermaidenchanted with all things human. Her father King Triton hates all humans, believing themresponsible for the death of his wife. Like teenagers everywhere, Ariel won't listen to herfather and runs off to her aunt, the sea witch Ursula. She makes a pact with Ariel: Ursulagets Ariel's lovely singing voice and in return Ariel becomes human. The mermaid has threedays to win the Prince and secure a kiss or she'll be doomed to torture forever. Joining inthe adventure is her friend Flounder (nursing a crush on Ariel) and the cranky crabSebastian.The film version contains seven songs and the first two are modest throwaways: "FathomsBelow" (sung by the petulant Prince who wants to be a sailor instead of becoming king) and"Daughters Of Triton." Those are followed by five gems, the four mentioned above and "LesPoissons." Very few musicals can boast five songs as witty and charming as these.Unfortunately, Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater needed to add a clutch of new songs to turnthe 82 minute film into a 135 minute stage show. Each new song weighs down the score,obscuring the gems that shone so brightly in the film. They're not awful as such, but they'recertainly not up to those standards and each so-so number makes it that much harder toenjoy the great songs when they arrive.A similar lack of imagination is found throughout the tech elements, from the scenic designof Kenneth Foy to the costumes of Amy Clark & Mark Koss to the lighting of CharlieMorrison to the choreography of John MacInnis. One might have expected a productionlinked to Disney to be "no expenses spared," the way Newsies proved to be. But theoverriding feel of this show is an essentially bare stage. And not a stage that's bare in theway a bare stage can encourage imagination. Just...bare.When Ariel and the Prince dance and quickly fall in love, the choreography is notablylacking and the ballroom they're alone in is represented only by two cardboard chandeliers.An underwater scene with Ariel bemoaning her fate includes two actors in the backgroundbrandishing signs that include tacked on fish in an attempt to give the illusion of a school offish swimming about. At another point, two actors are meant to be coral with perhaps seaweed floating back and forth in the currents rising up from them. On the near empty stage itlooks awfully meagre. When they go for a big splashy number like "Under The Sea," theMardi Gras-effect is both desperate and sorely lacking.It reminds us how unique and special a great animated film can be. It's a very particular artform. Look at "Kiss The Girl." In the film, this is a show-stopper of a number. Yes, the songis great in any context but the clever animation puts it over the top. Ariel and the Prince arein a rowboat. Sebastian and all the creatures around them conspire to create a romanticscene. Percussion on the shells of turtles, frogs providing backup singing and so on --literally the entire world is amusingly working hard to get them to kiss. It's funny, sweet,and romantic in the way lovers can imagine the universe is on their side. On stage?Sebastian is literally alone singing the song while the two would-be lovers sit in the boat.Now a literal reworking of that number would probably be a terrible choice. But they didprecisely nothing to find some new way of presenting that magical scene and the momentfalls flat."Les Poissons" is another good example. The scene in the film is a master class in furiousediting, close-ups and hilarious mugging as Sebastian tries to avoid becoming dinner. Onstage, they take their best stab at finally re-imagining a scene from the ground up.Unfortunately, it involves putting Sebastian under a dinner table and having waiter afterwaiter being dragged under in a Jaws-like frenzy. Instead of Sebastian running for his life,he now seems like a monster from the deep attacking humans. Why exactly would he callattention to himself? And how badly have they lost track of the purpose of the scene, thegenuine risk that threatens Ariel and her friends on this adventure?The problems with the show are certainly not with the casting, which is mostly solidthroughout. The roles of Ursula and Sebastian are the scene-stealing parts and both actorsrelish their opportunities. Liz McCartney has great presence as Ursula, nailing her bignumber "Poor Unfortunate Souls" and making the newer songs seem better than theydeserve. (This despite her banal costume with octopus limbs limply maneuvered by herunderlings.) Alan Mingo Jr. has fun with Sebastian, though a key change towards the finaleof "Under The Sea" makes the ending of his big number more piercing than it should be.Edward Watts has the right gravitas as King Triton and Christian Probst does what he canwith the uninteresting Flounder and that awkward costume. Jessica Grove is a likable Arieland it's hard to underestimate the challenges she faced in doing wire work, undulating andacting all while belting out her songs. Nick Adams is the weak link in a weak role as thePrince, bringing a John Davidson cheesiness to a character that needed all the help it couldget.The film is so appealing it seems inevitable that some day they'll try again. Here's hopingthey realize less is more. Stick to a 90 minute show since this sliver of a story doesn't wantto be expanded. Stick to a lot fewer songs since the five gems they have will shine thebrighter. And don't be so literal in trying to recreate underwater life. Less props and wiresand technical gizmos would allow audiences to use more of their imagination.FAR FROM HEAVEN **PLAYWRIGHTS HORIZONDirector Michael Greif, composer Scott Frankel and lyricist Michael Korie turned theunlikely source material of the documentary Grey Gardens into a memorable musical. Nowwith Richard Greenberg providing the book, they've tackled another unexpected project:taking the Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven and turning it into a musical. Led by KelliO'Hara as the 1950s housewife whose life is turned upside down when her husband comesout as gay and her black gardener is the only one who understands her, it's an intelligent,well-intentioned show that never remotely comes to life.The essential problem is that the marvelous film by Haynes is an homage to directorDouglas Sirk. Every element of the film -- the cinematography, the costumes, the lighting,the production design, the style of acting -- is consciously created in the style of Sirk. But it'snot an imitation or a modern updating of Sirk, as such. Haynes simply set out to make thebest damn Douglas Sirk film he could make, just as someone else might set out to make thebest darn Western they could. The gay storyline is not meant to underline the "dated"concerns of Sirk or comment on that filmmaker or the times the movie is set in. It's just aplot Sirk didn't tackle that Haynes could, though specifically in the style and manner thatSirk might have if he had the freedom. (Sirk certainly tackled social issues so it's very muchin keeping with his sensibility.)It's important to understand this when thinking about the film because it is very much afilm and every element is geared towards the heightened reality and melodramatic style thatSirk embodied more than anyone else. It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.
0:00 / 2:12
O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)
0:00 / 0:00
The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)? I won't be sure about TheCaucasian Chalk Circle until I see it again.THE THEATER OF 2013 (on a four star scale)The Other Place ** 1/2Picnic * 1/2Opus No. 7 ** 1/2Deceit * 1/2Life And Times Episodes 1-4 **Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (w Scarlett Johansson) * 1/2The Jammer ***Blood Play ** 1/2Manilow On Broadway ** 1/2Women Of Will ** 1/2All In The Timing ***Isaac's Eye ***Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale Of Musical Mystery ** 1/2The Mnemonist Of Dutchess County * 1/2Much Ado About Nothing ***Really Really *Parsifal at the Met *** 1/2The Madrid * 1/2The Wild Bride at St. Ann's ** 1/2Passion at CSC *** 1/2Carousel at Lincoln Center ***The Revisionist **Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella ***Rock Of Ages * 1/2Ann ** 1/2Old Hats ***The Flick ***Detroit '67 ** 1/2Howling Hilda reading * (Mary Testa ***)Hit The Wall *Breakfast At Tiffany's * 1/2The Mound Builders at Signature *Vanya And Sonia And Masha And Spike *** 1/2Cirque Du Soleil's Totem ***The Lying Lesson * 1/2Hands On A Hardbody *Kinky Boots **Matilda The Musical *** 1/2The Rascals: Once Upon A Dream ***Motown: The Musical **La Ruta ** 1/2The Big Knife *The Nance ***The Assembled Parties ** 1/2Jekyll & Hyde * 1/2Thoroughly Modern Millie ** 1/2Macbeth w Alan Cumming *Orphans ** 1/2The Testament Of Mary ** 1/2The Drawer Boy **The Trip To Bountiful ***I'll Eat You Last ** 1/2Pippin *This Side Of Neverland ***A Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney ***Natasha, Pierre And The Great Comet Of 1812 ***Colin Quinn Unconstitutional ** 1/2A Family For All Occasions *The Weir *** 1/2Disney's The Little Mermaid **Far From Heaven **The Caucasian Chalk Circle **Thanks for reading.

It's soap opera and almost camp (I'm thinking ofmovies like Written On The Wind and Magnificent Obsession) but of the highest level andso elevated in its technical brilliance that it transcends the "woman's picture" label and the"female" issues Sirk happily explored to become art.But if you take a Douglas Sirk film and put it on stage, you lose everything that makes itspecial. Without the lighting and editing and almost hyperreal cinematography and othertechnical aspects, you are left with only a melodrama minus the setting and particular filmicenvironment that makes it meaningful. If you're not going to put Charles Busch in the lead,you better seriously rethink what you're doing.Far From Heaven is a story of repression and right from the start we know they're not goingto capture what made the film special. The set is dour and dark, with steel structures movedaround to embody the staircase of a home or the office space or a seedy drinking hole and soon -- they're like the bars of a prison, a cage in which everyone is trapped, whether it's CathyWhitaker (O'Hara) in her loveless marriage, Frank Whitaker (Steven Pasquale) in hishomosexual desires and black people in a polite but racist middle class lily white Hartford,Connecticut. But those bars are too literal and downtown in their feel, far too specific andobvious for a Sirkian drama. Sirk (and Haynes) revelled in the lush worlds the middle andupper class people live in; these are gilded cages. Haynes recreated the heightened world ofmelodrama where a glance at a gardener would seem dangerous and thrilling. Stripped ofthat context, the very context that gives it meaning and purpose and tension, the story justseems tired and obvious.

O'Hara sings beautifully and delivers as always a wonderfully natural performance. She isnot matched by her male leads: Pasquale as her husband is lost in a cliched part whileJohnson has to deal with both the neutered Raymond and the gravitas that Dennis Haysbertbrought so effortlessly to the same role in the film. Neither is a match for O'Hara vocallythough in fairness Pasquale is given particularly awkward melodic lines that often end inthudding, low notes.The story is not sung-through but it almost feels like it since so many numbers are on tapthat the show is filled with songs that move the story along. Since this is a tale of repressedfeelings and emotions, even that works against the show. When a character finally burstsinto song, it should feel like a huge release. But every character bursts into song all the time.There's very little modulation either, so that when real emotions burst through you mightanticipate or even hear a little more naturalistic passion rather than the polite chirping ofsuburban society. But it's too little and too similar to what came before.Though the stage production has nothing in common with the film's look and technicalelements (which is the very heart of the film -- indeed, any film but especially the work ofSirk that Haynes is celebrating) it is slavishly faithful to every beat of the story. They use toomuch and too little of their imagination, stripping away the glamour and style that made thefilm affecting and replacing it with elements that make the tale simply mundane, one morestory of a closeted man and a loveless marriage and an almost romance that can't be.Certainly no new language is created to tell this story. When Cathy and the gardenerRaymond (Isaiah Johnson) go to a bar on his side of town, the entire clientele stares at themand makes her feel uncomfortable. This should mirror what happens when they bumpedinto each other at an art exhibit on an earlier night. Indeed, we're told by one character thateveryone was staring at them and scandalized by their behavior. But until the end of thescene, nothing in the staging by Greif tells us this. In fact, for most of the scene the otheractors have their backs to the two of them and they seem blissfully alone. In fact the rightchoice would be to let Cathy (and us) know the risk she is taking by merely talking with ablack man in her world at that time or at least be unaware of the drama she's creating. Inessence, their budding romance has no context and therefore no tension. They're alsodeveloping an attachment as they discuss the art and sing together for the first time. Butthere's no growing physical intimacy, no sense of sexual tension because they are almostshoulder to shoulder from the start of the scene. Another lost opportunity.One is temped to say the show is filled with them. But since you leave Far From Heavenwondering what possessed them to turn it into a stage musical in the first place, it's more ofan unconvincing choice than a lost opportunity.THE CAUCASIAN CHALK CIRCLE **CLASSIC STAGE COMPANYBertolt Brecht is a major figure in theater and like many people I've seen numerous versionsof Mother Courage, Galileo and The Threepenny Opera. But this was my first chance to seeThe Caucasian Chalk Circle, a show with numerous versions available, apparently includinga framing story that is often dropped.This time, the framing device is one that allows director Brian Kulick to lighten the mood.He has Russian actors speaking in their native tongue and apparently staging the play justas the Soviet Union collapses. That lets them hang striking Soviet-era propaganda posterson a stage filled with ladders and bare lighting. The power goes out in the middle of scenes,letting the actors burst into grumpy Russian complaints while struggling to start up thelights again and plead with the audience for their indulgence.The main story comes in two parts. In the first act, we meet a servant who rescues a baby ofaristocratic birth during an uprising in ancient Georgia, here called Grusinia. Grusha theservant (Elizabeth A. Davis) risks everything to protect the child: her future happiness withher love, her life when soldiers try to track the baby down and her honor when she marries a"dying" peasant to conceal the baby's identity. Sadly, she discovers the dying peasant isquite alive once the threat of war has passed and he soon cruelly demands his marital rights.To make matters worse, the child's imperious mother (the peerless Mary Testa) returns toclaim it only because the baby is her key to fortune and security. The servant insists thechild is her own but her fate and the fate of the baby she loves is in the hands of a mercurialnew judge (Christopher Lloyd)

The rather laborious second act takes a long time to establish how this new judge came intohis position. Finally the trial takes place. Until then, Lloyd seemed to be afraid that anythingother than morose quiet would be too entertaining for a serious work by Brecht. But whenhe's not playing the narrator (called The Singer even though Lloyd almost never sings)Lloyd finally comes to life as the oddball judge who dispenses his own brand of justice withaplomb.The final trial -- involving a Socratic-like determination of the child's "real" mother -- issatisfying though it feels like the show was merely treading water for most of the second actbefore we got there. Throughout we have songs with lyrics by W.H. Auden and new musiccomposed by Duncan Sheik. His melodies have Sheik's distinctive mournful, twilightatmosphere well suited to the dimming of the Soviet experiment. No one is sorry to see thattotalitarian state fall but they're certainly uneasy about what lies ahead and Sheik capturesthat uneasy moment well.A few actors shine and no one is less than solid including Lloyd once he wakes up. Davis is asolid, sympathetic lead. Testa is a delight in various roles. And the talented Jason Babinksyas a lawyer, a nephew and the hateful "dying" peasant among others makes a very strongimpression in various parts. He was so dissimilar in certain roles I was surprised moreactors didn't take the stage at the bow.Despite the pleasures various actors bring and the music of Sheik, the evening as a wholefelt a little dutiful. The framing device added humor but it also added length to theperformance. (The mild audience participation moments were also time-wasters with nopayoff, especially a scene where some are dragged on stage to people a wedding for noparticular purpose and certainly no humorous benefit.) And much of act two feltunnecessary though I'm not certain whether it's Brecht or this production that should beheld accountable. It's the feeling you sometimes get in your youth when seeing certainShakespeare plays for the first time. Is it one of the weaker ones (Titus Andronicus) or just aweaker production of a good show (The Winter's Tale)? I won't be sure about TheCaucasian Chalk Circle until I see it again.THE THEATER OF 2013 (on a four star scale)The Other Place ** 1/2Picnic * 1/2Opus No. 7 ** 1/2Deceit * 1/2Life And Times Episodes 1-4 **Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (w Scarlett Johansson) * 1/2The Jammer ***Blood Play ** 1/2Manilow On Broadway ** 1/2Women Of Will ** 1/2All In The Timing ***Isaac's Eye ***Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale Of Musical Mystery ** 1/2The Mnemonist Of Dutchess County * 1/2Much Ado About Nothing ***Really Really *Parsifal at the Met *** 1/2The Madrid * 1/2The Wild Bride at St. Ann's ** 1/2Passion at CSC *** 1/2Carousel at Lincoln Center ***The Revisionist **Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella ***Rock Of Ages * 1/2Ann ** 1/2Old Hats ***The Flick ***Detroit '67 ** 1/2Howling Hilda reading * (Mary Testa ***)Hit The Wall *Breakfast At Tiffany's * 1/2The Mound Builders at Signature *Vanya And Sonia And Masha And Spike *** 1/2Cirque Du Soleil's Totem ***The Lying Lesson * 1/2Hands On A Hardbody *Kinky Boots **Matilda The Musical *** 1/2The Rascals: Once Upon A Dream ***Motown: The Musical **La Ruta ** 1/2The Big Knife *The Nance ***The Assembled Parties ** 1/2Jekyll & Hyde * 1/2Thoroughly Modern Millie ** 1/2Macbeth w Alan Cumming *Orphans ** 1/2The Testament Of Mary ** 1/2The Drawer Boy **The Trip To Bountiful ***I'll Eat You Last ** 1/2Pippin *This Side Of Neverland ***A Public Reading Of An Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney ***Natasha, Pierre And The Great Comet Of 1812 ***Colin Quinn Unconstitutional ** 1/2A Family For All Occasions *The Weir *** 1/2Disney's The Little Mermaid **Far From Heaven **The Caucasian Chalk Circle **Thanks for reading.
