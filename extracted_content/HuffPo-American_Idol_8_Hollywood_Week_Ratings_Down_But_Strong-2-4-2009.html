 American Idol  -- Hollywood Week
Ratings Down But Strong
Read More:  American Idol , Paula Abdul , Pop Music , Randy
Jackson , Reality TV, Ryan Seacrest , Simon Cowell , Entertainment News
OK, so I didn't post last week for two good
reasons: my computer collapsed again (I spent somuch time at the Apple Store, they should havepaid me an hourly wage) and I headed downsouth to Alabama for my mom's 80th birthdayparty. Guess what? Old people tend not to havewireless networks in their home and theStarbucks in Birmingham closes really early. Myquick impression of last week was that we saw afew more successful auditions (in short bursts)but quite a few questionable people got through.
Hollywood Week continued that trend. According to Marc Berman of MediaWeek , the overnight
ratings for the Tuesday Idol were solid: the show scored a 14.0 rating. Ratings have yo-yo'd all overthe place this season. Last week (with three episodes) reached 24-26 million people and wenthigher than the equivalent week last year. But last night's show reached about 26.3 million people(per Hollywood Reporter ), which is about 25% lower than the first night of Hollywood Week last
season (which came a week later and scored a 17.3 rating). Still it's growth over last week and lastweek was bigger than the week before. American Idol  is the #1 show on TV.
Lots of news: the Top 36 people competing for the Final 12 slots has possibly leaked online. Checkout the Huffington Post link here  or go directly to the NY Post, which has a nice run-down  of the
entertainment careers of some of the contestants, including stints on Nashville Star, roles as childactors, recording of CDs on their own and so on. We've got to accept that anyone driven enough toget to Hollywood Week on Idol probably HASN'T been sitting at home in their bedroom: peoplewho want to be stars claw their way to the top and Idol won't always be their first stop. Vote ForThe Worst.com has the complete alleged list.
Ken Levine didn't even watch the episode  but groaned anyway. Entertainment Weekly's Michael
Slezak  has a great suggestion: why not make the final cut to the Top 36 a live episode rather than
taping it weeks in advance? That way there would be no chance of the info leaking out. And it's still

Song Hits Radiosnot too late for Idol to take advantage of the intertubes: as soon as the Top 36 is official, maybe
THEN they could post all their auditions online so we can check out the ones who haven't receivedairtime. Go to the  official Idol  forums  and champion this idea.
My biggest complaint about Hollywood Week is that I still feel like there are loads of people I don'tknow yet. The judges cut 147 people down to 104. No one was cut that seemed deserving to go on(keeping in mind that we didn't see performances by most of them). But some that did get throughseemed highly questionable. What did you think of:
Nathaniel Marshall -- an 18 year old emo kid with lots of tats and a sensitive soul who sang an
obscure song called "The Anchor Holds" and broke down crying while defending his song choice. By
the way, I disagree with Paula when she criticized the song because it didn't have a broad range to
show off his voice. Does every song have to cover three octaves? Can't someone deliver a great
performance of a song with a modest range? To me, the range of the song wasn't the problem --
the fact that it made little impact was.
Rose Flack  -- sang a very flat, uninteresting take on "(Sittin' On The) Dock Of The Bay."
Von Smith  -- the cute guy who over-emoted facially and made Simon wince and declare it
"indulgent nonsense." (In this case, the other three judges were right, I think.)
Jamar Rogers -- the buddy of Robert Downey Jr lookalike and superior singer Danny Gokey,
Jamar sang "California Dreamin'" and left me cold again.
Katrina Darrell  -- the bikini girl who delivered an extremely modest version of Faith Hill's
"Breathe" and while it's amusing to see the gals get annoyed by Simon and Randy champion her, it
would be more amusing if they didn't also put her through.
Emily  (I missed her last name) -- the cool-looking punker who had a bold song choice she
rehearsed endlessly and then "panicked" and chose a really boring song she hadn't rehearsed a whit
and delivered a poor performance of it to boot.
Nick Mitchell aka Norman  -- the guy who dons a headband and dorks around in a "fake"
persona. This has to be the most annoying send-through of them all. Nick camped his wqy through
"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" and if he were auditioning for a sketch comedy show, I'd sayhe was fine and shameless. Paula said it would be nice if he actually just sang a song. You think?Perhaps the reason is -- duh -- he isn't memorable as just a singer. And this is a SINGINGcompetition. So why didn't the judges applaud him for being amusing (not to me, mind you) andsend him on his way?
What did you think of these performers geting through? Were there any others you found
questionable? Anyone who impressed you more than with their original audition? (I found oilrigger guy Jeremy Michael Sarver to be better the second time around.) And ain't YouTube great?Does Von Smith out-sing Lil Rounds  on the Dreamgirls showstopper "And I Am Telling You I'm
Not Going?" And how long before we hear Adam Lambert sing the Gnarls Barkley tune "Crazy"  on
air? See you tomorrow.

One more thing or ten-
WHO IS THAT NEW JUDGE? 
What other reality show was she dragged from, was she one of the crazy ex-Idol rejects, 
or is it in her contract that she has to keep kissing and kissing up to Paula? 
AND Ryan Seacrest has a "Girlfriend"? Was this a typo on E! ?
bbbtmenw See Profile  I'm a Fan of bbbtmenw  permalink
The fix was in already. The picks were made. Several "cuties" were passed through just for their looks
(Oh, mister musicals boy with the big mouth and weird facial expressions), their previous audition (Nonot bikini girl), their family stories for publicity (dead wife/new "buddy" and the Osmand "don't you haveyour own IN to getting a contract 'cause your family has been in the business for YEARS" who has ahealth problem with seizures boy), less on performance (many of the favored blew their auditions), andthen there were the quotas (oops, we already have three cute darkish Mexican/Latin olive skin looking
guys, we can't pass through another), and then the crazy heavy older psycho and the stripper-esque
"Paris Hilton" girl to keep the crazy interview cycle alive.
I am not trying to sound prejudice or judgmental on the family or health issue candidates. I am judging
the judges. Don't eliminate those who are good just because you have too many of one look, don't passthrough someone you know is WRONG, and what about your previous rules and statements. If theydidn't listen to you about not crying, begging, or picking a decent song and totally blowing it, why passthem through?
I am sure sad and happy that my roommate DVRs the program. Sad, 'cause I end up seeing each one.
Happy that I can skim through it and then feel better when I press DELETE and get rid of one moreepisode.

Don't you know it is against God's law to worship idols? Change the name of the show to Americansinger or American performer or American Rock Star - something like that....

I must say that American Idol is really missing the point. This is a singing competition, and though the
auditions are supposed to drive the ratings (at least I assume that's why they air so many ridiculous
auditions) they could, at least, air more of the Hollywood performances. I would like to see why these
people made it this far, and more importantly, why those who were cut were sent home. I feel likeHollywood Week should be moving us into the main course of the show, but again we're beingbombarded with unnecessary back story. If they insist on airing the back story of the contestants, whynot show more of the "boot camp" footage to get an idea of how they prepared for Round 1. I'm reallyinterested to see Emily's performance of her original song choice since they aired the commendationshe received from the "boot camp" counselors.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
I agree 100 percent. I'd love to see boot camp -- hey Idol, more stuff to post online!Remember, they've reduced Hollywood Week to one week and just a few hours so they canrealistically only show so much. But why waste the footage? put it online. And I'd much rather
see an emphasis on the work they due to perform then backstories of people and bad
auditions and tantrums.

Glad to see you back Michael! I was worried last week, all I had to capsule was Slezak"s thoughts! I dototally agree about posting the 36 online because last night there was so little to savor and so little timeto do so " I had to pause the TiVo to look at the line and see if any of my early favorites were there.(Note " please de-glam Mr. Lambert " he looked just fine before!). It would help if we at home had ascorecard! I have been avoiding the leak, so thanks for not commenting. So far I like the waif Rose, butthe dirty feet need to go!
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
I think maybe Lambert likes the glam. Look how sexy/glamy he is on that YouTube video. Butyeah, I liked his more casual appearance better too. And Rose is interesting. Thanks forposting.

Well, Bill, I wasn't familiar with that website. I'll bookmark it and keep it in line. I waswondering if the Osmond contestant we saw was one of THE Osmonds. Good to knowthough I don't think it's a scandal that Simon worked with Marie Osmond. We've seen plentyof people auditioning who were relatives of celebs or Idol contestants. And none of themhave won. The winners have all been relative unknowns. (Though Kelly had done demo workand I think had a CD, Taylor Hicks had a CD he did himself and released in Alabama etc.)There's just very little chance that someone who NEVER performed anywhere (no band, noTV, no local theater, no self-recorded album) would suddenly at 21 walk into an audition and
be a complete unknown. I definitely prefer the folks who haven't had a major label push
behind their debut album to those who have so I hear where you're coming from.
