            <p>M O N D AY,  O C TO B E R  1 6 ,  2 0 0 6CBGB's Is DeadIt joins a long list of departed rock clubs, like the Bottom Line. Butwhile I'm sorry to see CBGBs go, I'm not really sad. It's not like theclosing of independent bookstores where there are no new ones to taketheir place. Other clubs have opened and become the hot place to seebands. And tradition is great, but rock n roll ain't about tradition. As afriend said when she went to see one of the last shows, "What a dump!"I've seen some good shows there, but for a good decade now CBGB'ssurvived by letting any old new act tramp through their doors. Cool,but not a way to program a great venue. What was the last new banddiscovered or deified at CBGB's? The usual list - the Ramones, TalkingHeads, Television, etc. -- ends pretty conspicuously in the late 70s early80s. Same thing with the Bottom Line (which I went to a lot more). Inever did get a chance to see Springsteen pop in and recreate his epic"Born To Run" concerts, but I did see great shows by Lyle Lovett, LindaThompson and others. But for at least the last 10 years of its life, theBottom Line hardly even tried to keep its bookings vibrant: they keptrotating the same aging acts again and again and again. The sense ofdiscovery was long gone. So a hearty cheer for CBGB's past, just as longas you keep in mind that its heyday was in fact long past. P.S. If it evercomes up at a bar's trivia night, the initials stand for Country,Bluegrass and Blues.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

Michael in New York said...Sure, absolutely. I didn't mean to imply that NOTHING had happenedat CBGBs. But even Soul Coughing is more than a decade ago. If it'sbeen 10 years since a club launched an act or had memorable shows,maybe it's time has passed.
