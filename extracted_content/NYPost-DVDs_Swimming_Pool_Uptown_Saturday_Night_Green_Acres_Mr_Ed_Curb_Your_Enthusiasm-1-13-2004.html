In the provocallve 
"SWimming PooL" 
"SWI:MMI:"iG POOL" 
French director Francois Ozon's nl0st recent film, the 
English-language "Swimming Pool" ($26.98, Universal), 
\vas his biggest hiI yet. fullov{ing the anlusing!y theatrical 
Fassbinder play "Water Drops on Burning Rocks," 
penetrating eLrama "Under the Sand" and the frothy 
musical "8 ,,\Vomen.~' The plot of this beautifully 
photographed psychological mystery \\Tas atypically 
obvious -uptight English mystery w~iter (the marvelous 
Charlotte Rampling) is loosened up by a sexy, even 
coarse, young French woman (Ludivine Sagnier). Sagnier 
certainly did a marvelous job of lying by the pool in her 
bikini. 
"UPTOv\TN SATURDAY NIGHT" 
Sidney POltier's screefl persona. is indelibly that of the 
righteous, almost saintly black man, and no one ever seems 
to remember that Biil Cosby once starred in a successful 
movie. But both of those images 2.re laid to rest with their 
larky 1974 buddy comedy "Upto\vn Saturday Night," along 
'iI'ith the two "sequels," "Let's Do It Agaiil," from 1975, and 
~:'A. Piece of the Action," froITl19TJ ($1997 each, \Varner 
Bros.) Curiously, neither Poitier nor Cosby contributed to 
the documentaries or commentary tracks. 
"GREEN ACRES": COMPLETE FIRST SEASON 
THE BEST OF "MIL ED" 
"1<1r. Ed" is rig:htlv remembered as one of those rather 
dumb, high-cOI~cept sitcoms. But "Green Acres" (539.98 
each, 1\1Gl\!D -while it certainly feveled in dumbness as 
well -\-vas a rather sneakily self-aw·are, almost surreal 
show that made fun ofTY conventions, broke down the 
fourth wall a la ·'Burns & Allen') and·even made hay out of 
the show's opening credits, Ifl~ads liHton had studied 
Eva Gabor, she would have learned how to fit right Ln 
\vithout giving up he:-sense of style (or humor). 
"CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM", COM.PLETE FIRST 
SEASON 
"LOST IN SPACE", COMPLETE FIRST SEASON 
Larry David's acquired taste of a sitcom, "Curb Your 
Enthusiasm" CJ;39.98, HEO), has every a\vkward moment 
preserved from its debut season, including aU 10 episodes 
and the HBO special that launched it. The most fun comes 
from celebs like Ted Danson, Richard Lewis and Diane 
Keaton, who gleefuliy tweak their public personas. "Lost 
in Space," on the other hand, has always had a wider and 
Inore mainstrean1 audience in mind. You might have 
outgrown this space opera after the age of 5, but for a while 
the campy Dr. Smith, the robot and the Robinsons were 
good friends to anyone needing an elementary lesson in 
greed, danger and bravery ($79.98, Fox). 
Also out: "l\1adame Sata" (S24.98, VJellspring) is an 
uneven drama bur features an extraordinary perforrnance 
by Lazaro Ramos as a \·icious Rio streer punk turned 
Queen of Carnival; the fInal showdm.vn "Freddy vs. 
Jason" \vas a complete disappointment ($2935, Ne"\v Line); 
Joaquin Phoenix is the sole "vmrtny elen1ent in the military 
comedy "Buffalo Soldiers," set in the dying days of the 
Cold "\-Var ($29.99, 1\tflramax); Neil Patrick Hanis voices 
Peter Parker in the niftily animated MTV shO'iv HSpider­
IVia...l1: The Ne·w Animated. .seriesY~ ($29.95. Colun1bia 
TriStar); Rov\~an Atkinson continues his string of siJ!y 
blockbusters 1-\,-ith the Bond spoof HJohn:uy English~l 
($26.98; Universal); and 1981's ".ilmde Special 
AnniversaryEdition '~ ($19.95, Colulnbia TriSt8r) !nay 
have been completely supplanted by Rob I',Iarshall's 
'~!inning 1999 TV movie version, but it's nice to have Carol 
Burn.ett and Aileen Quin.li.'S perfonnances presenfG.
