10/27/2004 11:26:00 PMFor the first time in 86 years, the Boston Red Sox have won the WorldSeries, ending the most famous slump in baseball and the mostfamous "curse" in all of sports. People have been born and sufferedand died without seeing Boston win the World Series and it happensin the year when John Kerry is running for President? That's as gooda portent as you could hope for. And since John Kerry moved fromnailing Bush's incompetence to a message of hope this week, weshould too. Everyone is thoroughly freaked out by the polls and won'ttake anything for granted. So I don't think it's damgerous to expressmy hope that JOHN KERRY IS GOING TO WIN!!Two good baseball signs: I was in Yankee Stadium when theflag-waving, military-cheering blue collar Yankee fans BOOED DickCheney's scowling face when it appeared on the video screens duringa regular season game. Sweet.Finally, I'm a die-hard Yankee fan with season tickets in the bleacherswho happily chants 1918 (the last time Boston won it all) at the dropof a hat. But when my Bush-voting friend asked me during game oneof the Yankees v Boston playoffs if having John Kerry be Presidentwould mean having Boston beat the Yankees and win the WorldSeries, what would I choose? I said without hesitating that I wouldchoose the future of my country over the Yankees. And he tauntedand teased me for not being a real fan.But I know what's truly important. Thank God Boston won the WorldSeries and thank God John Kerry will win the election if we all go outand vote and drag our friends with us. (But next season it's back tobooing Boston. Go Yankees!)
