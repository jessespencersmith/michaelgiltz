RATINGS UPDATE:  American Idol  scored 24.2
million viewers on Tuesday's audition show in Los
Angeles,  per The Hollywood Reporter.  That's down
just 5% from the 25.5 million people the equivalent
episode last January but a step back to reality after
last week's episodes somehow increased  roughly30%
over the year before. It will of course be the #1 show of
the week as Idol  marches towards becoming the first
show in TV history to be #1 for six years in a row. Only
three shows have been #1 for even five years - All In
The Family  and The Cosby Show  did it five years in a
row, 60 Minutes  did it non-consecutively.
SHOW COVERAGE: Here are the numbers you need to know in order to slog through the Tuesday
edition of Idol : 12, 23, 39, 46 and 57. Jump to those minutes to watch the only full auditions of golden
ticket winners. (We also see a brief montage of other successful candidates at the end.) Just barely morethan one good audition every 15 minutes made this show drag on. And since about 22 people got throughto Hollywood, why did so few of them make the cut for air time?
Two guest judges included an uninteresting Avril Lavigne and a very tart Katy Perry, who had the
sharpest riposte to Kara who went on and on about the inspiring backstory of a young man: "This is not aLifetime movie!" No, but sometimes the Idol  producers want it to be. Here's a rundown of the five people
who got winning tickets.
JIM RANGER  (12 minutes in) -- Sang "Drive," an original. A quick shot of Ryan shows him warning
friends of Jim that it's awfully hard to impress the judges when singing an original. Surprisingly, not only
is Jim good, so is his song (though the judges didn't really comment on it). Good raspy Southern rockvoice. Annoyingly, Avril and Kara decided this father of three maybe couldn't handle committing to a
rock career AND a family AND his church. Uh, isn't that the same issue every person longing for a career

Weight...in music faces? Whether they're a roadie or the lead singer? Do Kara and Avril only hire single people
not in serious relationships for tours they're involved in? In any case, Jim had a strong audition and fills
a useful niche that could carry him far if he gets by Hollywood.
MARY POWERS (23 minutes in) -- Sang "Love Is A Battlefield" by Pat Benatar. Simon nailed her for
looking derivative rocker-chick-ish. And to me her vocals were too much of a copycat of Benatar, down to
the vocal quavers. (She also had some dorky hand gestures; I hope they're just dumb and not mimicking
the music video.) Powers was also a bit nervous and for all that she wasn't bad, just not distinctive.
ANDREW GARCIA (39 minutes in) -- Sang "Sunday Morning" by Maroon 5. Also a dad (though no on-
air complaint from Kara about his dereliction of duty) with parents who were gang members but moved
away to give their kids a better chance. Despite a heart-tugging backstory (which can turn me off)
Andrew sailed effortlessly through his vocals with a sweet, controlled tone. Love it when people don't getall Mariah on us. Quite strong and the best of the day.
TASHA LAYTON  (46 minutes in) -- Sang "Baby Baby Baby" by Joss Stone. Well-dressed woman who is
a personal assistant by day and minister by night. Good performance, quickie audition with no
sentimental backstory but at least we got to hear her sing.
CHRIS GOLIGHTLY  -- Sang "Stand By Me" by Ben E. King. This young man -- who went through
literally dozens of foster homes -- was the source of Katy Perry's tart "This is not a Lifetime movie"
comment. He keeps his eyes closed throughout most of his audition, which makes me worry about Chris'sstage presence and nerves down the road. But it was a sweet. straightforward vocal and he's appealing.Simon and Katy gave him a yes but with a small "y," but I agree more with Kara and Randy that he'spretty intriguing. Plus, he's already got a great last name for a pop star!
So another city with only five full auditions and lots and lots of filler and clueless folk. Again, FOX should
post the complete auditions of all 22 golden ticket winners. So what did you think of the five who got
through? And what did you think of Katy and Avril?

0 FansI couldn't agree more. Some of us watch for the performanc es, to see potential stars in the making,
and gauge the contenders ' stages of developmen t as the season progresses . I personally couldn't
care less about the no-talents , freeks, losers, and borderline sociopaths who bomb their auditions. It
would be nice if the producers of the show didn't feel compelled to dumb it down so much. Definitely
out of balance.
Also, I thought Katy Perry looked exquisite, her demeanor appropriat e, and her snarky comments
dead on, mostly. Kara's "oh-no-she -di'in't!" nonsense and derisive neck-snapp ing is more than
grating.
I thought the guest judges were horrible. I actually kind of liked Avril Lavigne before the appearance
. She seemed like a self-impor tant little miss priss. She made it clear that she thought she was way
too good for the people around her. 
Katie Perry was absolutely mental. She is seriously mentally ill. Sorry, but she was abrasive and
completely uncivil. She must be an utter nightmare to be around. Especially after her hit. Theyshould have just kicked her out. She was a complete pill. 
I liked the preacher/s oul guy, sort of like that guy last year, what was his name? Andrew Garcia
killed. I thought he was great, though he isn't a hunk, so his days are numbered.
Danny Gokey? He's got a new video on the Idol website. Thanks for reading. Looks do
matter of course, but Ruben Studdard won and he's no pin-up either.
I thought Katy Perry was fantastic last night. Honest, funny, no BS...and she looked amazing. It wasgreat to hear her call out Kara one more than one occasion. her comments were right on and Iwould love to see her come back. Avril was annoying as usual. Too immature, giggly, and not reallya good judge. Please do not have her back....ev er!
I personally thought Avril was adorable in her devil hoodie. I just wanted to give her a big hug.TOP VIDEO PICKS

She did look cute. I just didn't find any of her comments interestin g or helpful, especially
compared to Katy Perry. But maybe Im just a frustrated Idol judge/pop star.MORE BIG NEWS PAGES  »
