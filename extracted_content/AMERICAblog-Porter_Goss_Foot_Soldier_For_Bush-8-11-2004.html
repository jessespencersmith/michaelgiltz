8/11/2004 02:26:00 AMThis is Bush's nominee for the C.I.A. and his savvy, un biasedanalysis of North Korea's nuclear proliferation:"On June 1, Goss took part in a Bush-Cheney conference call withreporters to critique Kerry's first national security speech [reports TheWashington Post]. He described one of Kerry's nonproliferationproposals as 'naive,' and answered 'clearly yes,' to a question aboutwhether Bush's policy toward North Korea was producing results.North Korea, he said, is 'no longer making the progress they weremaking at Yongbyon [their key nuclear production site] and otherplaces because we have called their bluff.'"In fact, since the Bush administration confronted the Pyongyanggovernment, North Korea has thrown out inspectors, removed nuclearfuel from internationally monitored storage, and may have increasedthe size of its nuclear arsenal, according to U.S. intelligence."The article further details Bush's reasons for nominating Goss, gettingits scoop from Republican insiders. Bush's thinking has a lot to dowith polls, trying to hurt the Dems politically, catching up with Kerryand so on but very little to do with Goss's fitness for the role. Ain't itsad that even Republicans don't offer up as reason number one thatthey believe Goss would be the best person for the job?Maybe "foot soldier" should be changed to lapdog. AnotherWashington Post article today details Goss's recent transformationinto a Bush water carrier, along with his "part of the problem" attitudetowards the dysfunctional C.I.A."Over the past month, Goss, 65, exhibited little enthusiasm for thebroad intelligence changes proposed by the Sept. 11 commission,urging caution instead and proposing legislation to expand the powerand budget of his old agency."'It's regrettable that he's as close to the agency as he is,' said FrankJ. Gaffney Jr., president of the Center for Security Policy, aconservative Washington think tank. 'He's been implicated in thedysfunctional congressional oversight that the 9/11 commissiondocumented. I don't know that those things are disqualifying, butthere may be other candidates that are better.'"
