            <p>Newer PostOlder PostF R I D AY,  A U G U S T  1 1 ,  2 0 0 6Candi Staton In ConcertI had a very busy week with movies, book readings and concerts. Onedefinite highlight was soul singer Candi Staton at the Bowery Ballroomon Thursday night. She was in terrific voice and the place was full offans. It was a mixed crowd but for some reason it was the white peoplewho felt they should sometimes hold their hands in the air as if theywere at church and ocassionaly encourage her on with "Sing it, girl."The set wasn't wholly satisfying -- I would have preferred a muchheavier dose of her classic songs on the FAME label -- and her bandwas fine but not transcendant (which showed during her introductionof the members and their usually uninspired solo turns). But she wassweet and talkative and even gave a shout out to the press, thankingthem for their attention. (I don't think I've ever heard a music act thankthe press before.) "I'd Rather Be An Old Man's Sweetheart (Than AYoung Man's Fool)" was great, as were her covers of Merle Haggardand Elvis Presley and Tammy Wynette. And the gay boys in the crowdloved the finale, which included her big dance hits "Young Hearts RunFree" and "Victim," neither of which is a good showcase for her voice.But the show was entertaining throughout (especially the dorkyArgentinian in front of me who would insist on dancing -- I wisely justleaned against the wall and tapped my toes). And her performance ofthe title track of her new album -- the quietly devastating "His Hands"-- was a showstopper. I can't remember the last time everyone atBowery Ballroom shut up for a slow number, but this was the sort ofperformance where even the bartenders stopped serving drinks so theycould listen.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
