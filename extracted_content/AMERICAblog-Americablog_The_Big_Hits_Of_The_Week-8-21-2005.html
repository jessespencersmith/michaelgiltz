8/21/2005 03:30:00 PMA weekly rundown of the top postings on Americablog. Theseare the stories that drew the most traffic and generated themost comments.Americablog isn't just for weekdays anymore. The weekend isgetting more and more traffic as people realize Americablognever sleeps.THE WEEKENDJohn (temporarily) in Paris discovered the power of sternlanguage with two fiery pieces, "Bush Is A God Damn Liar" and"Leave September 11 The Fuck Alone."Cindy Sheehan stayed high in our interest with Joe in DC's twoitems "Front Page of Washington Post for Cindy Sheehan" and"Bush Uses Radio Address To Talk To Cindy Sheehan."The Washington Post's bizarre decision to sponsor a Pentagonwar rally climaxed with John (temporarily) in Paris urgingreaders "Tell The Washington Post To Stop Sponsoring pro-Bushrallies." The Post later dropped its support.And Iraq's neighbor got a little nervous after Joe in DChighlighted the breaking story that "Bush Says He'd Use ForceAgainst Iran."MONDAYThe harrasment of a grieving mother continued as Joe in DCpointed out with postings "Shotgun Hospitality For CampCasey" and "The neighbors are getting cranky.""What Makes People Gay?" from Michael in New York inspiredlengthy debate.Karl Rove is never far from our thoughts, thanks to Joe in DC'supdate "More On Why The FBI Didn't Believe Rove From TheStart."And Michael in New York continued his questioning ways with"What To Do With Europe's Muslims?"TUESDAYCindy Sheehan still had us rapt with attention. That brutaldesecration of the war memorial was detailed in "TheNeighbors Are Getting REALLY Ugly" from Joe in DC and John(temporarily) in Paris's look at "Pro Cindy Sheehan Protest AtUS Embassy, Paris, Wed Aug 17."Michael in New York took Bush to task for not condemning thatnasty act with "Mockery Of The Fallen: Why No Outrage?"And Karl Rove (who feels the legal noose tightening aroundhim) got his due with "Michael Wolff Is Absolutely Right AboutRove and the Media" from Joe in DC.
