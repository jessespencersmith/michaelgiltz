From the Publisher:
In The Hidden Life of Trees , Peter Wohlleben shares his deep love of
woods and forests and explains the amazing processes of life, death, and
regeneration he has observed in the woodland and the amazing scientific
processes behind the wonders of which we are blissfully unaware. Muchlike human families, tree parents live together with their children,communicate with them, and support them as they grow, sharing nutrientswith those who are sick or struggling and creating an ecosystem that
mitigates the impact of extremes of heat and cold for the whole group. As
a result of such interactions, trees in a family or community are protectedand can live to be very old. In contrast, solitary trees, like street kids,have a tough time of it and in most cases die much earlier than those in a
group. Drawing on groundbreaking new discoveries, Wohlleben presents…

What We Say
This charmingly discursive book by Peter Wohlleben is like wandering an old growth woods with a lovable and informed
forester by your side. For Peter (I feel on a first name basis), this tree here and that root system there and the stump overyonder all prompt comments and stories. Brief chapters focus on various topics like Friendship and The Language Of Trees
and Love and ...wait, what?  And that mischievous description of trees in the subtitle -- what they "feel," how they
"communicate?" It's not so fanciful, but apparently grounded in the latest scientific research. Trees do in fact communicate
with themselves and others (via scent and electrical impulses and sound and intermediaries). They tend to their young.Share This Book

<p>They share resources with other species. Their roots are mind-blowingly extensive and along with fungi it amounts to an
underground "internet" that has been dubbed the wood wide web. Scientists are just now tracing how nutrients pass back
and forth among competitive trees in a dance of mutuality, to give just one tiny example from the afterword.  Peter clearly
and directly spells out what is going on during storms and in "plantation" forests and trees growing in urban environments,
urging you to open your eyes the next time you enter a real forest and look for things like forked trunks and young beechesbiding their time in the shadow of larger species. His insights are never loaded with scientific jargon and hisanthropomorphism is playful and inviting. This ramble is so plotless one should become impatient. Except every little
chapter is simply bursting with fascinating detail, like the way rain water pours down the trunks of some trees and is
shunted aside by the conifers of others. Or what to look for in the bark of trees and why branches rarely grow close to theground. Trees, like ents, work on a very different time scale than us. But "slow" does not mean trees are objects, likerocks. They are more like animals than the easy categorization of "plants"and "animals" would have one believe, he says. Bythe end, you'll be inclined to agree a lot more than you did at the beginning. Frankly, I was relieved to be holding an e-
reader -- having a print edition of this work (made out of the pulp of dead trees!) would seem almost...rude. I'm no naturist
but this book is a treat. My one complaint is that it features just a few simple drawings. I wanted hundreds  of them or
preferably photographs illuminating what Peter is telling us. Already a big bestseller in Europe, I've no doubt this couldcapture the imagination in the US as well and a fully illustrated edition might follow. And I hope someone puts it in the
hands of the team behind the documentary film "Blue Planet" and its like. As crazy as it sounds, a documentary film about
trees should be just as exciting as all those nature movies where hunter stalks prey. It's eye-opening, sweet-natured(literally) and filled with information that makes you want to pause and say to the person next to you, "Hey, did you knowtrees can...?" -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
"The matter-of-fact Mr. Wohlleben has delighted readers  and talk-show audiences alike with the news — long
known to biologists — that trees in the forest are social beings." —Sally McGrane, The New York Times
"If you read this book, I believe that forests will become magical places for you, too ." —Tim Flannery
"Peter Wohlleben is a generous and knowledgeable guide into this fascinating and complex secret world hidden in
plain sight. The Hidden Life of Trees  is a powerful reminder to slow down and tune into the language of
nature. " —Rachel Sussman, author of The Oldest Living Things in the World
"Charming, provocative, fascinating . In the tradition of Jean-Henri Fabre and other great naturalist story-
tellers, Wohlleben relates imaginative, enthralling tales of ecology."—David George Haskell, author of The Forest
Unseen , Pulitzer finalist
"Wohlleben’s book is at once romantic and scientific , beautifully articulating his personal relationship with the
trees he has dedicated his life to. His view of the forest calls on us all to reevaluate our relationships with the
plant world." —Daniel Chamovitz,…
