 Battlestar Galactica  Finale DVR

If you're like me, you're really excited about the
series finale of Battlestar Galactica , one of the
best shows of the past five years. In the old days,that meant plopping down on the couch Friday at9 p.m. to see the show. Today, that means settingyour DVR and catching it later Friday night orthat weekend.
WARNING!SyFy (yes, that's how they spell their name now)
has just announced that the series finale is not 2 hours long. It's two hours and eleven minutes
long! As so often happens, this is not  reflected yet on my cable TV schedule and probably isn't on
yours either. If you don't want to miss the last 11 minutes of the series finale, you must  go to your
TV and either extend the episode an extra 15 minutes (or half hour) or just tape the next showairing on SyFy.
I have a special twist because I'm taping the episode repeat at 11 p.m. (I also tape Friday Night
Lights  and Bill Moyers in Primetime  and they conflict with the original broadcast.) Now with the
original airing running through 11:11, does that mean the rerun will begin a few minutes later or11:30 or what? To be safe, I'm taping the channel from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. Reset your DVR now oryou'll have to watch it online or buy it on iTunes or just burn with frustration.
And what do you expect in the finale? I thought the miniseries was good, the first season great and
the second season even better. They stumbled a bit in the third season but are barreling towards afinale with great momentum. The cast is outstanding and I for one can't understand why TriciaHelfer  hasn't been snapped up by a Scorsese or some other great director. She can do anything.
(She does appear on Burn Notice  in a recurring role.)
What do you expect to happen? Will Starbuck (Katee Sackhof, another fun actress) and Apollo(Jamie Bamber, sigh) get it on for good? Will Gaius (James Callis) ascend into the heavens and

The emotional depth with which Galactica approached tense subject-matter was without parallel in
science fiction. I would often find myself in deep reflection over many of the issues theytouched...genocide, torture, imperfect often hypocritical justice, battlefield stress, desperation,unrequited love, just to name a few. No doubt I will miss it's unique way of encouraging theseponderances.
Though the series had to end, I was a little unsettled with the seemingly hurried wrap-up. It only
confirmed the rumors that the show was having financial difficulties, often true of cult-classics, and had

limited time. Do understood the necessity of tying up loose-ends, but I felt that the they-live-happily-
ever-after but in a Matrix-world seemed almost anti-climatic. I would have rathered they all died,
perhaps in the raid on the Cylon Homeworld, fitting of the overall tragedy that was the storyline.
Cinematically, Galactica was a masterful sci-fi opera, the mood setting was excellent (even if "dark-
shadowy shakey-home video style" constantly reminded me of '24') and the music choreography wassuperb. Bear McCreary is a true genius.

I always thought Kara Thrace's "wing" tatoo was pretty spectacular -- especially with the rathermysterious empty circle at its base. Her becoming an angel after her death and guiding the fleet to apreviously unknown earth turned the tatoo into a sort of visual prophecy of her final role.
Personally, I thought the mysticism was a little heavy-handed. 
Having said that, I must also say that the notion of a beyond-good-and-evil cosmic intelligence running
the complex biological/mechanical system of humans/cylons through cycle after cycle in the hopes that
there would eventually be a different outcome was expressed pretty elegantly once the pieces came
together. In all, a very interesting way to allow randomness (or free will) & predestination & cyclicalrebirth to co-exist.
I wept at the end...
ragz2008 See Profile  I'm a Fan of ragz2008  permalink
I confess, I am still mystified on how Kara was an angel and didn't know it til the last second, it almost
seemed like she was more of a death-and-resurrection Jesus-type than angel who at the end,ascended into heaven if we go with a blend of concepts. (By the way, the theory of her being the firstcylon/human hybrid since she's Daniel's daughter is great, and her being an "angel" almost puts hercloser to that Galactica 1980 episode where we see the original Starbuck protect an "angel" andbecome the "father" of a hybrid.)
More questions: Did they ever explain what happened to the "Boxey" character they introduced in the
miniseries or was that Ron's way of messing with us? 
The cylons lived thousands of years, right? How did they make it to earth? Were they cylons before
Caprica created them? Did the Caprica version just retreat during the war and find this thousands of
years old "cylon" colony? 
The time line is pretty fuzzy for me here...can anyone help?
MoreLiberalWithAge See Profile  I'm a Fan of MoreLiberalWithAge  permalink
The 5 "original" Cylons are thousands of years old because they traveled from their "Earth" to
the Colonies in a sub-light speed ship, and time slowed for them (Einstein's Theory ofRelativity). Thus they were able to survive the journey back to the Colonies. The ancestors ofthe 5 were Cylons that were created on Cobol(sp?). Those Cylons were originally entirelyrobotic but evolved into clone cyborgs who eventually became able to procreate, and in theprocess lost resurrection technology. Thus, Ellen, Saul, Tory, Sam, and Galen were all bornfrom mothers and aged like humans. However, the 5 of them worked together to recreateresurrection, which is how they survived their own nuclear holocaust (which resulted from aconflict between the humanoid Cylons and the robotic ones). They then traveled back to thecolonies to try to stop a similar conflict between humans and robotic Cylons, but found they
were too late, as they arrived during the first Cylon war. They went to the Colony's cylons and
created the 7 new humanoid cylons (and gave them resurrection technology), in the hopesthat if they had human form, they would be more sympathetic to the "real" humans. But theywere wrong.
Hope this helps...this is what I understood from a bit of explication by Sam Anders shortly
before he went into surgery.

that is part of the mystery and magic of the show. I think the whole thing about Starbuck being an angel
and how she just vanished was great. Roslyn was such a great character. The final battle scene justawesomely orchestrated. To the trolls who complain (and I'm not talking legitimate criticism) why do
you watch? BSG was the work of Ronal Moore. It's his vision. His masterpiece. End of story. The show
was great. I will miss it just like I do a great book when I finish reading it. Parting is such sweet sorrow.
I'm glad they made it to earth, our earth. I still don't get the opera house motif, I don't know, maybe thewhole show was just one big operetic story line being played out. Edward Jame Olmos was great asAdama. Thanks Ron Moore, thanks for the great mind blowing entertainment. Let's see now, B5, Firefly
(alas too short but we do have the movie) and BSG. That's some great science fiction television. Heros,
Lost and even Smallville will just have to do the job. Now where are the Westerns (I know Deadwooddoes count)? Can't anyone write a good Western for television?
GravitonX See Profile  I'm a Fan of GravitonX  permalink
My biggest disappointment with an otherwise good show was it's amazing lack of Blacks in anything buttertiary roles. Yes, it's science fiction, but for a show that set itself to be a thoughtful canvass ofconventional issues, it was sorely lacking in this regard. Sure, many white fans will see nothing wrong,perhaps, because they can often exist for extended periods of time without any meaningful interactionwith anyone outside their race, but for other minorities, the overwhelming abscence was salient. Even
in the season finale, when the show attempted to make a boldface connection of science fiction and
science fact, the whitewashed narrative couldn't even bring itself to present Blacks in any significant
role, even in Africa.
ChironexFleckeri See Profile  I'm a Fan of ChironexFleckeri  permalink
Unfortunately, as a "white guy," I will have to agree. I knew it was going to come up. I was a
little leery of the "replacements" overall from the start. I loved the fact that they completelychanged the personalities...Gaius(my favorite and the one I most personally identify with),Starbuck, both Adamas, Boomer, Tigh, nearly the entire cast, but I was always a littleuncomfortable that african-americans were not cast in significant roles, as well. Hollywoodsometimes takes a few steps foreword and backward at the same time, but I hope you liked
the show as a whole. I'm sure there will be great sci-fi in the future featuring african-
americans cast in leading roles. Art is always evolving.
dkuz09 See Profile  I'm a Fan of dkuz09  permalink
I'll have to disagree on that front with you. Although it is true that blacks definitely only played
minor roles in the series, that is not to say that the canvass was totally wiped clean of anyminorities at all. I mean, how could you even state that when you have Edward James Olmosplaying the lead character, Admiral Adama (and he did so with so much intelligence andbrevity, I might add.) You also had the hindu actress (can't remember her name at the
moment, so please forgive me) playing Tory, one of the final five cylons. And Dualla, who
committed suicide earlier in the second half of the season had a pertinent story line to play
too, and I believe she is a black actress of South African descent. And there was also Gaeta.
Its very easy to condemn broadcast television for its lack of ethnicity, but cable television
does seem to have its finger on the pulse of America, and BSG certainly did with its talentedcast. Would I have liked to see more 'black' actors play a part in the series? Of course, whynot? But I'm not going to say that just because it didn't have 'black' minorities that it lacked inthat regard. You had some of the best parts in the series given to minorties and for that Ithink is a step in the right direction in my book.
GravitonX See Profile  I'm a Fan of GravitonX  permalink
The idea that minorities are "interchangeable" therefore a representation of "some"minority should satisfy "all" minorities is fairly condescending, and I'm sure you didnot mean it as such, but in effect that's the point. You claim that BSG had it's fingeron the pulse of America, yet in the same general breath you admit Blacks onlyplayed a minor role. I do not wish to belabor the contradiction but the dissonance isapparent and the rationalization is fairly tortured.
It would seem nearly unimaginable that in America they could find no
AfricanAmerican, yes, Black, to fill anything but a minor role. As I said, in the season
finale, when they find Earth and land in Africa, they could find no Blacks. They alsoembarked on tangential explanation of the origins of humanity (remember the"bones of a little girl - presumably Hera - found in Tanzania" headlined in the end ofthe seaon finale) essentially reinventing an Africa without Africans. Remarkable. The

opportunity to be one of the truly great progressive social commentaries using
science fiction. But, perhaps, in it's lack, it did.

Kudos to the producers of BSG!! The series finale did not disappoint!! All the loose ends and hanging
questions were all answered and came together nicely! A much better series ender than SG1 orAtlantis. It was nice how Starbuck's death and return, Baltar's visions of six and vis versa, and thevision at the cathedral that was experienced by Roslyn, Athena, Balter and Six throughout the seriescame together at the end. This show was one of the best sci-fi shows ever. It's darker sub plots added
a sense of realism on how it would really be if a small remnant of the human race were fleeing and
fighting for their lives against an enemy that had overwhelming force and motivation to destroy them.

I generally agree. 
I thought the battle at the colony was a bit silly and the deus ex machina was a bit heavy

They left some very juicy question unanswered off course I might have missed something... We stillhave that direct to dvd movie "BSG:The plan" coming up and the Caprica pilot but what we sci-fi fan

should not last past season two.

What a great two hours and eleven minutes of television. To answer your questions, Kara Thrace is a

Thank you, Ron D. Moore for ending BSG on the highest note out there. Truly amazed.

I'm ticked about the extra 11 minutes, since I heard that it was to include previews of other shows, not
because BG itself runs long. I don't need more ads for new programming on "SyFy" (ticked about thattoo). Now I have to hope I set the darn DVR right. I promised to wait and share it with my husband,who won't be home, and missing the final 11 minutes will send us both absolutely over the edge. 
The notion that everyone's a Cylon is appealing, but I'm not sure I buy it. Didn't Baltar eventually make
a working Cylon detector that could distinguish between Cylon and human? Implies there's somethingto distinguish. Ah, well, it's not long until we find everything out.

I agree - I think they'll - we'll - all be Cylons in the end. I hadn't thought about the idea of the Cylonsmaking the humans. Good call.

I hope they don't screw this up. They've got a lot to cover in the last episode and I fear some of my own
burning questions might go unanswered (please explain how the Centurions evolved to "discover" theirgod, please explain the apparent real-life Earth connection provided by "All Along the Watchtower,"please don't spend another minute on who loves who or what and why...).

thanks for the heads up! Going to set my Tivo now. I think all main characters make it except Laura.She'll die in the admirals arms. But Starbuck's story is really a mystery. I have no idea where they aregoing with that. I'd love it if they would do a spin off of this show with the Starbuck character or a pre-quel of their life on Caprica. 
I'll miss BG!!

My guess is that Starbuck is Daniel's (the 13th Cylons) daughter. And when he was
boxed/destroyed is when he disappeared from her life.
