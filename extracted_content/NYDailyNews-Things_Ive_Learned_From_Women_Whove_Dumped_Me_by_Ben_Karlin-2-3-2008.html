Dumped Me i

guys sobbing on their bathroom floor from
heartbreak will find comfort here.
First, very few of the writers actual-
ly talk about being dumped. Another prob-
lem is that their voices blur together. Snarky,
vaguely naughty put-downs are the default
mode, and with few exceptions it's as if all
the essays come from some tibercomic with
a reallybad dating record.
Ultimately, all a reader can do is ruthless-
ly reject most of the pieces and go steady
with the few that catch the eye. I'll be returh-
ing the phone calls of Marcellus Hall, who
drew a witty, two-page comic strip on "the
lessons of a cyclical heart." I'll be flirting
madly and suggesting drinks with Dan Sav-
age, who tells a hilarious story about sleep-
ing with a girl to bry to avoid the fact that
he's gay. And I'll heave a sigh of relief after
reading Bob Kerrey's sweet, poignant story
of falling in love with a girl in a photograph ,
- finally, after all these guys and their is- ,ii
sues, it's a pleasure to hear from an adult. i$
