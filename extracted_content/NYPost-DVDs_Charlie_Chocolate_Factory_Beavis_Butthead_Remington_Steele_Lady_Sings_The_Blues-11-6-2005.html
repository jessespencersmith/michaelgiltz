Chocolate Factory: 
Deluxe Edition 
* (Warner Bros., $30.97) 
WHO knows why this point­
less remake became such a big 
hit? The sets are boringly 
identical to the 1971 version. 
And the songs -using awk­
ward lyrics direct from the 
Roald Dahl book -are much 
weaker. Finally, Johnny Depp 
is so desperate to be different 
from the brilliant Gene Wilder 
that he's just plain creepy. 
Extras include how to dance 
like an Oompa-Loompa and a 
chance at a Golden Ticket. 
Beavis and Butt-head: 
Vol. 1, The Mike Judge 
Collection 
*** (Paramount, $~8.99L __ 
GETTING rights to all those 
music videos makes a season­
by-season collection of B&B 
all but impossible. So fans of 
stupid, grunting, sub-frat boy 
humor will have to settle for 
this collection of some 40 car­
toons and 11 videos with their 
obnoxious commentary, a 
Thanksgiving special, promos 
and more. 
Remington Steele: 
SeasonlWo 
***1/2 (I.ox, $39.98) 
PIERCE Brosnan was born to 
play James Bond. And he 
proved it via this witty drama 
about a debonair con man who 
teams up with a private detec­
tive (Stephanie Zimbalist) to 
solve crimes. This season 
brings Doris ("Everybody 
Loves Raymond") Roberts as 
their computer-savvy assis­
tant, not to mention fan­
favorite episode "Red Hot 
Steele." Genial fun. 
Lady Sings the Blues 
*** 
(par~0~nt.J14,99 L __ _ 
AS Diana Ross explains in a 
neW 23-minute documentary, 
she'd just left the Supremes 
and was worried about her 
future when Motown head 
Berry Gordy created this 1972 
vehicle for Ross to tell the sto­
ry of troubled blues legend 
Billie Holiday. Billy Dee 
Williams and Richard Pryor 
are good, but the real surprise 
is Ross. She's so magnetic that 
you can't believe this melodra­
ma didn't lead to a real movie 
career. -Michael Gilt;;</p>
