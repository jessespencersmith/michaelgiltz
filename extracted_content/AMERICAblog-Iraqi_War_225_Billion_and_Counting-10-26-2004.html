10/26/2004 03:41:00 AMOk, a few weeks ago John Kerry was shredded for suggesting that thetotal cost of fighting in Iraq was $200 billion. He was quite reasonablytaking the total amount already spent by the debates ($125 billion)and the money that was going to be needed in the coming fiscal yearthat started in the beginning of October. That money was alreadyneeded and in fact delaying the requests meant the final bill would behigher (delayed repairs cost more). But Bush was afraid to let theAmerican people know the truth about what the real financial burdenof the war was becoming.Now the Washington Post reports that Bush is going to be requestingabout $70 billion (more than the year before) and when you add inspecial funding requests, the cost is now $225 billion and counting.That only gets us to next October and of course the stronger theinsurgency gets, the more money we'll need. That's more than$1000.00 for every single adult in the country. Guess you can handthat modest tax break right back, along with your sons anddaughters.
