The Day After 
Tomorrow 
* Fox; $29.9~ _____ _ 
A disaster film that's a disaster? 
How appropriate. Not even 
Dennis Quaid and the 
disarming Jake Gyllenhaal can 
inject smarts into this bit of 
nonsense about an instant 
climate change ravaging North 
America. One amusing 
moment shows u.s. citizens 
streaming across the border to 
Mexico, but the rest is brain 
dead. The extras -including 
commentary tracks and some 
deleted scenes -are 
remarkably sparse for a special­
effects flick. 
The Battle of Algiers **** Criterion; $49.95 
Director Gillo Pontecorvo's 
blistering, classic 1966 drama 
-shot like a documentary -
captures the insurgency of 
Algiers against French 
occupiers so convincingly that 
militaries around the world 
have studied it for years. 
Suicide bombings, struggles to 
tell friend from foe, torture in 
the name of good -it's all 
here. The remarkable extras on 
this three-disc set include 
seven substantial films (nearly 
five hours in total), including a 
making-of the film, a history of 
the actual Algerian struggle 
and much more. The Ren& 
StimpyShow 
-First and 
Second 
Seasons **** Paramount; $38.99 
Happy, happy, joy, 
joy! One of the most 
perverse, goofy and 
downright hilarious 
cartoons arrives on 
DVD. Creator John 
Kricfalusi was fired 
after season two 
(shame on you, 
Nickelodeon), so 
this is the only 
"R&S" you'll ever 
need. The worthy 
extras: a banned 
episode, 
commentary by John 
K, storyboards and 
pencil tests. 
Taxi First SeasonIThe 
Wire First Season *** each 
Paramount/HBO; $38.99/$99.98 
An instant top 10 hit, "Taxi" has 
always been more of a quiet, 
critic's favorite than a popular 
juggernaut. It's a marvelous 
ensemble about New York 
cabbies that endures because 
the characters 
are so human. 
Another quiet 
success: "The 
Wire" on HBO, 
which 
demands 
repeated 
viewing. 
Neither has 
extras and 
neither needs them. 
The Nutty Professor 
Special Edition *** Paramount; $14.99 
It's a happy day indeed for the 
French, since Jerry Lewis' 1963 
masterpiece about a meek 
professor who becomes a suave 
ladies' man is out on DVD with 
commentary by Lewis, two 
solid shorts and archival 
material. It's one of 10 Lewis 
films coming out on DVD 
today.(including 1960's "The 
Bellboy" and 1964's "The 
Disorderly Orderly"), so Lewis 
fans should be sure to buy a lot 
of popcorn and unplug the 
phone.</p>
