            <p>THINK OF THE ODDS. Oprah Winfrey may be a one-per-Oillrah WHOOPI GOLDBERG WHIPPED 
INTO OUR CONSCIOUSNESS 
playing a lady-lover in The Color 
Purple. But the shy role she 
played to perfection in Steven 
Spielberg's drama is a far cry from 
the truth-telling, dirt-dishing atti­
tude of Goldberg the woman. How 
appropriate then that she has now 
found success on-<>f all places-­
her self-produced game show. 
"Anyone who could make Holly­
wood Squares not square has a 
will of steel and a lot of chits to 
call in," notes Scott Seomin, enter­
tainment media director for the 
Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against 
Defamation , which bestowed a 
wildly eloquent Goldberg with the 
Vanguard Award at the GLAAD 
Media Awards in April. "She was 
gay-friendly before it was trendy." 
Besides, replacing fey Paul Lynde 
in the center square adds immea­
sW"ably to her cachet anl0ng gays. 
son conglomerate today, but early on she was a down-to- .t--<. 
earth black woman trying to make it on the whiter-than- WIN F HEY 
white talk tun. These days while Springer et al. exploit 
their guests for freak appeal, we trust Winfrey to tell oW" stories with respect-as she did 
when she warmly hosted Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche on her show soon after they 
announced their love. Gay men have reason to feel at home with Oprah too. "I've never 
been able to put my finger on why gay men identify so strongly with black women who 
overcome hardship ," says Rich Tafel, executive director of the gay group Log Cabin 
Republicans. "But we do. Oprah's not a victim. She's taken control of her life. And my 
sense is that for her, the gay issue is a nonissue. The way she treats her gay guests, she 
normalizes it-unlike so many of the other talk shows." Winfrey, who is bringing her 
brand of enlightenment to the magazine world next year, continues to rewrite the rules.
