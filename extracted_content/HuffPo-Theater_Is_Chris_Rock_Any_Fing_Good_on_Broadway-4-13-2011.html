 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyTheater: Is Chris Rock Any F***ing
Good on Broadway?
THE MOTHERF**KER WITH THE HAT  *** out of
****
SCHOENFELD THEATRE
Playwright Stephen Adly Guirgis hits Broadway with the
very funny, solidly written show with a title that's NSFW:
The Motherf**ker With The Hat.  Guirgis is one of the
most talented and acclaimed writers around, having
made waves with previous Off Broadway shows likeJesus Hopped the 'A' Train, Our Lady of 121st Streetand The Last Days of Judas Iscariot.  In the world of
theater, he is a star.
Despite the excitement of seeing Guirgis coming into his
own and getting the visibility of Broadway, it's not surprising that the show made it to Broadway in part
because the producers cast actor and comedian Chris Rock in his Broadway debut. So the first question
out of anyone's mouth is, "How is Chris Rock?" The answer: not bad.
Rock is a natural on the stage, of course. And when he's delivering his lines -- and he does deliver them,
as opposed to simply saying them or fully inhabiting a character -- he's very convincing, especially whenthe great dialogue by Guirgis allows Rock to deliver hilarious lines about sleeping with a friend's girl andhow they're not actually friends but it wasn't cool of him to do anyway.
The problem comes when Rock isn't  talking. Then he seems to freeze a bit onstage and not offer anything

<p>for the other actors to play off. Rock projects well (no small thing in a Broadway house, but years of
stand-up took care of that) and hey, performing live is very, very different from acting on film. Greaterskill and the ability to inhabit a character even when that character isn't talking might come with timeand a lot more work. He acquits himself admirably if you grade on a scale. It seems clear that Rock'spresence in a key role perhaps keeps the show from reaching its peak artistically. But he's not a deadweight either and unlike other celebrities turned thespians, fans can enjoy seeing him without worrying
about whether he'll remember his lines or embarrass himself. Not at all.
It helps immeasurably that Rock is surrounded by an excellent cast and performing in a very funny and
involving work. Even if the title isn't one you'd want to repeat to your mother. Here's the cast discussingit with Broadway World.
Rock plays the AA sponsor of Bobby Cannavale's Jackie, a guy just out of prison and on the right track.He's not drinking anymore, his girlfriend is hot and he's just landed a job with possibilities of "careeradvancement." Then he spots the hat. Whose hat is sitting on the table in their apartment? His girlfriend(a confident, sexy Elizabeth Rodriguez) reacts angrily. How the hell is she supposed to know whose hat itis? What does it matter? How could he doubt her? He has insulted her! In other words, when cornered,she goes on the attack and tries to drive the idea of infidelity out of his mind.
Soon we see Jackie meeting with his sponsor, crashing on the guy's couch and avoiding the advances of
Rock's wife (Annabella Sciorra). He buys a gun and shoots the hat in front of the guy he thinks  was
cheating on his girl. That creates more problems (the guy is on probation, after all) and soon he's hiding
the gun at the home of his weird cousin Julio (a scene-stealing Yul Vazquez).
Friendship, trust and insecurity all come into play. Is Jackie to blame for his girlfriend's cheating because
he proved time and time again that she couldn't depend on him? Are people in 12 step programshypocrites if they backslide in other parts of their lives? Or is Rock as Ralph D. correct when he says allthat AA is trying to do is keep him from drinking and drugging? It doesn't turn people into saints anddoesn't even try, he says.
Cannavale is the heart of the show as he struggles to control his temper and angrily rejects any idea that
cheating around doesn't really matter in the end. It matters and Cannavale is marvelously good at miningall the humor and pathos out of Jackie's desperate desire to hold it together while also yearning forrevenge. Another Tony nomination is clearly in the works. So is one for Vazquez, who plays Cousin Julio.Is Julio gay or straight? I'm still not quite certain but I know that Vazquez is hilariously good with hisprecise line readings and repeated offers to get all "Van Damme" on the people messing with Jackie.Director Anna D. Shapiro molds the performances into one cohesive whole that reveals the pain at theheart of Jackie but never misses a chance for humor.
The great jazz artist Terence Blanchard provides the music, mostly brief bits of score played during scene
changes. His film and TV work is often exceptional but Blanchard may have been frustrated about theminimal opportunities this show offered and his work is undistinguished and even a little murky. Evenless praise can be offered for the scenic design by Todd Rosenthal. The quick changes from one

<p>apartment to the next are all fine. But the set is dominated by a sliver of skyscraper skyline and a wholly
unnecessary, even confusing metal structure that seems to be the back of a billboard sign without anyadvertising on it. It certainly gets across the idea of an urban landscape but is so dominating and yetvague (at first I thought it was a drawbridge) that you're continually distracted by it.
The exact opposite is true of the writing by Guirgis. It's solidly built and every line, every scene has a
purpose. He's a genuine talent and it's great to see him on Broadway where he belongs.
