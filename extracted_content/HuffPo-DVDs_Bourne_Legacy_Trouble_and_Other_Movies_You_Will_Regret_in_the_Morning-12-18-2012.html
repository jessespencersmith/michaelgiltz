THE BOURNE LEGACY  ($34.98
BluRay combo; Universal)
TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE  ($35.99
BluRay combo; Warner Bros.)ICE AGE: CONTINENTAL DRIFT($39.99 BluRay combo; FOX)TOTAL RECALL  ($35.99 BluRay
combo; Sony)KILLER JOE  ($24.99 BluRay;
Lionsgate)TED ($34.98 BluRay combo; Universal)-- You know the walk of shame? That's
the idea in the movies that when
someone has a one-night stand they
regret, they have a walk of shame
home the next morning, certaineveryone is aware of their bad, baddecision. You should think about thewalk of shame you have to make afterrenting or buying a lame movie, thetrudge back to Redbox or Blockbusteror your neighborhood store. You knewThe Bourne Legacy  wasn't going to be
any good. You knew your friends hadseen it and been lukewarm at best. Youknew you'd spend the entire moviewaiting for Matt Damon and debatingwhether Jeremy Renner is a movie star.And yet still you rented it rather thansome classic movie from the past. Andyou return it and the attendant says,"How was it?" and you say, "Mehh."
Because what else can you say? What
can you say about Trouble With The
Curve?  That Justin Timberlake is
getting better as an actor? That at least
Clint Eastwood didn't talk to a chair?Can you explain why you haven't reallyliked any of the Ice Age  movies but at
least you know what you're getting andso you get it anyway? Will you debatewith friends how this Total Recallmanaged to avoid all the quirkyelements of the last Total Recall  and
how both of them aren't nearly as goodas the work they're based on? Will thatbe fun? At least Killer Joe  is based on
an acclaimed play and MatthewMcConaughey is having a career year.But shouldn't it have come after about adozen other genuinely great crime
movies you've never seen? As for Ted ,
isn't it really a funny idea... for five
minutes? Wouldn't it have been a lotfunnier as a sketch on SNL  rather than
a feature-length movie? And even if youlaughed, aren't you secretly dreadingthe sequel? Even though you knowyou'll see it? Because that's what keepsyou repeating the walk of shame againApril 30, 2014

<p>and again and again.
THE QATSI TRILOGY  ($79.95 BluRay;
Criterion)
A MAN VANISHES  ($44.98 DVD;
Icarus -- out Dec. 22)
PURPLE NOON ($39.95 BluRay;
Criterion) -- Koyaanisqatsi  is one of the
all-time great films and was  certainly
the best movie of 1983.  If you've never
seen it, this Criterion BluRay releasewill be a revelation for you. Thisdocumentary has been so influentialthat it might not stun the way it did in1983. The movie drew upon manyavant garde techniques andpopularized them and its DNA can beseen in movies, music videos,commercials and films ever since. On avery basic level, it is a nature film, usingtime-lapse photography to capture theworld. It moves from the desert into thecity up into space as it follows the pathof a rocket. The wordless narrative is
set to the score of Philip Glass, which
was created alongside the film, with
each influencing the other every step of
the way. Director Godfrey Reggio surely
intends a commentary on modern life,
but the movie is greater than anyreductive idea such as "nature good"and "mankind bad." In fact, the beautyhe captures in the streaming traffic onthe highway or a production line in afactory complicates such ideastremendously. It is hypnoticallybeautiful, transfixing and in this beautifultransfer will immediately become afavorite "demo" BluRay for hometheater enthusiasts. Aestheticallyarresting, emotional, philosophicallyintriguing, Koyaanisqatsi  is above all a
work of beauty, utterly singular andstriking. This Criterion set does it full
justice with bountiful extras, shorts,
interviews, essays and more. It truly
was singular, though Reggio did try and
recapture that flash of brilliance with
two lesser sequels, Powaqqatsi  and
Noqoyqatsi . Both are their adherents
but no one would argue they're a patch
on Koyaanisqatsi . Shohei Imamura has
won the top prize at Cannes twice butmost of his work is little known in theU.S. This marvelous release of hislandmark documentary film A ManVanishes  should change that. You not
only get the movie -- in which Imamurainterviews the family and friends of amissing businessman and slowlyinsinuates himself into their lives -- butyou also get five more documentaryfilms from the early 1970s, key works inhis career. That means this DVD isreally an exceptional boxed set of a
major talent. Finally, any fans of The
Talented Mr. Ripley  should check out
Purple Noon , an earlier French
adaptation by Rene Clement. It has lessemotional complexity than MattDamon's version but Alain Delon is soremarkably handsome as themurderous charmer Tom Ripley that allcritical faculties go out the window.
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE THE
COMPLETE TELEVISION</p>
<p>COLLECTION ($359.99 DVD;
CBS/Paramount)J.A.G. THE COMPLETE SERIES($359.99 DVD; CBS/Paramount) -- Two
more deluxe TV boxed sets that do
everything right... except the packaging.
Mission Impossible  contains the entire
innovative original series and the
revival from the 1980s in a 56-DVD set.
JAG contains all 10 seasons of the
journeyman TV series that was foolishlycancelled by NBC and then flourishedon CBS and spawned two massive hitspin-offs: NCIS  and NCIS: Los
Angeles . Has any show that close to
death ever proven so ultimatelysuccessful? Each contains bonusfeatures and other extras. Both arecontained nicely compact sets: MissionImpossible  is in a fun, dynamite stick-
looking box. JAG  is in a handsome
briefcase. The problem occurs whenyou open them up. Mission  comes in
round tins for each season. They're alittle tricky to stack and unstack andmore annoyingly each tin contains a pile
of discs in a flimsy photo album
container that's a pain to pull out and
remove the disc you want. JAG  really
has a handsome, sturdy case that
makes the cheap cardboard holders foreach season all the more disappointing.They have no identifying titles on theside so you can't take them out andplace them on a shelf on their own. TheDVDs themselves are in a stacked,folder-type container that's tiresome todeal with when you want to remove orput back in a disc. On the bright side,the sets themselves are at leastcompact and can fit on mostbookshelves nicely. Too bad thedesigners of boxed sets never considerthe people who will actually want to usethem.
PITCH PERFECT  ($34.98 BluRay
combo; Universal)
SLEEPWALK WITH ME ($29.98BluRay; IFC)PREMIUM RUSH  ($35.99 BluRay
combo; Sony)ARBITRAGE  ($24.99 BluRay;
Lionsgate)WHY STOP NOW  ($29.98 BluRay;
IFC)REHEARSAL FOR A SICILIANTRAGEDY  ($24.95 DVD; First Run
Features) -- Unlike the batch of moviesthat topped this column, here are some
films you might take a chance on that</p>
<p>could pay off. Pitch Perfect  is Glee  goes
to college but it's most notable as the
successful feature film debut of directorJason Moore, who scored on Broadwaywith Avenue Q . Mike Birbiglia is a
distinctive standup comic. I saw hisshow Sleepwalk With Me  and this film
smartly expands his tale with a look atthe life of a standup comic. PremiumRush  is nonsense, of course, but it is
fun to watch Michael Shannon lettingdown his hair as a villain. God knowswhat Joseph Gordon-Levitt wasthinking. Arbitrage  is a drama about a
Madoff-like schemer whose schemesare blowing up in his face. Richard
Gere stars and he's often best when
playing compromised characters.
Susan Sarandon and Tim Roth are
along for the ride. Jesse Eisenberg is inthe same fix as Topher Grace, trying tonegotiate that awkward period betweenteen and adult roles. Why Stop Now  is
only a way station but Eisenberg'sessential appeal remains intact. Finally,if you're a fan of puppetry like me, JohnTurturro's journey to Sicily andimmersion in that art form will please.
GIRLS COMPLETE FIRST SEASON
($49.99 BluRay; HBO)SHAMELESS SECOND SEASON($49.99 BluRay; Warner Bros.)41 ($19.98 DVD; HBO)
HOUSE OF LIES FIRST SEASON
($45.98 DVD; Showtime)
CAPTAIN CORNELIUS CARTOON'S
CARTOON LAGOON VOL. 1  ($12.99
DVD; Cartoon Lagoon)
THE LIFE & TIMES OF TIM THIRDSEASON  ($29.98 DVD; HBO)
CALIFORNICATION FIFTH SEASON($45.98 DVD; Showtime) -- LenaDunham's HBO show Girls  is by far the
most distinctive series coming to DVDthis week. The real test for this comedywill be how it fares in season two. CanDunham shake off the accolades andmake the show better? Shameless  has
been lost in the shadows on Showtimebut it's a great showcase for William H.Macy. The documentary 41  looks set to
be a franchise for HBO -- this one looksat George Herbert Walker Bush and
now they're tackling Bill Clinton. Don
Cheadle is having fun as amanagement consultant on House OfLies but I'm happiest to see Kristen Bell
back on TV since Veronica Mars.Captain Cornelius Cartoon's Cartoon</p>
<p>Lagoon  hopes to have fun with old
cartoons the way MST3K  did with old
movies, starting here with the mumbling
Popeye and a weird Captain Nemo tale.Tim keeps bumbling on in the thirdseason of his not-so animated life buthe's a model of self-control comparedto the sexaholic of David Duchovny in
Californication .
DICK TRACY  ($26.50 BluRay;
Touchstone)
TRAILER WAR  ($27.97 DVD; Draft
House Films)MIAMI CONNECTION  ($27.97 DVD;
Draft House Films)THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY  ($19.97
BluRay; Shout) -- Warren Beatty madea bold stylistic gamble that still pays offon this excellent-looking DVD. Sure,you can see the painted backdrops inscene after scene, but it's intentional --this Dick Tracy is all cartoon colors and
artificiality. Richard Sylbert's productiondesign is one for the ages, thoughBeatty didn't quite match it with a toneand flippancy that would have made themovie soar. Still, it holds up very welland it's a pity no one bothered to
discuss this genuine roll of the dice.
And surely someday soon someone will
tackle Dick Tracy again. Trailer War  is a
foolproof compilation of nutty film
trailers. Two hours long, it's bestsampled in short doses before whateverfilm you're watching each night. MiamiConnection  is just the sort of turkey that
would be enshrined in Trailer War ; it's
one of those awful flicks that fans havetaken to heart as gloriously awful to thepoint of... well, awful. But they enjoy it.Others will surely prefer the failed butfar more ambitious adaptation of Henryjames, The Portrait Of A Lady.  Jane
Campion faltered for the first time here,though Nicole Kidman gives her all asIsabel Archer. The extras include a newdocumentary about the making of thefilm.
