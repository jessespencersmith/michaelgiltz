WE HAD NO RIGHT 
The gay right-wingers ' cover 
[Issue 562] is deeply shocking 
and offensive. I know of no one 
who would claim that gays-in 
or out of the closet-who favor 
free markets, limited govern­
ment, and (until receritly) skep­
ticism about Soviet Communism 
are in any way anything like, 
Nazis. And I can see nothing to 
be gained by such a suggestion.

CONSERVATIVE YOUTH 
As an openly gay conservative 
college student, I looked for­
ward to reading your story "Gay 
Conservatives: Friends or 
Foes?" I presumed it would be 
about people like myself, who 
fight for gay rights but also hap­
pen to he conservative on for­
eign policy and economic issues. 
Instead, what I read was a story 
on gay conservatives who are in 
the closet. 
The criticisms leveled against 
them ~ that they must compro­
mise their principles, they must 
lie about their private life to pro­
tect their career, etc.-apply 
just as strongly to gay liberals 
who work in Washington and 
don't feel ready to be honest 
about their sexual orientation. 
You might have written about 
the men and women who or­
ganize the national gay con­small group of people and attack 
them for not being open about 
their sexual orientation -never 
remembering that most gay 
people from every imaginable 
economic, social, and political 
background are also in the 
closet. If the gay community ex­
pects society at large to become 
more tolerant of diversity, we 
must learn to be a lot more will­
ing to accept it from our own. '

WHO ASKED HER? 
Re Pat Califiis reply to the nar­
cissist in Adviser, Issue 562: 
Who was asleep when this piece 
of judgmental smarm went to 
print? I'm personally impressed 
to death that Ms. Califia is 
threatened by male narcissism. ' 
Big deal. Who wants to hear 
about it in an advice column 
about male sexuality? The man 
who wrote asked for advice, 
which is (correct me if I'm 
wrong) what an advice colwnn is 
, used for. He received exactly 
what he did not ,ask for:­
opinion,s. 
This gal needs a vacation 
(make it a long one) and also the 
name of a good shrink to cure 
her of her homophobia. Would it 
have been so hard for her to tell 
the guy about the many fine J/O 
clubs that abound during these 
hard times instead of wetting 
her pants because he wasn't ask­
ing for her opinion? Get over it, 
girl.
