            <p>he world was riveted
in January and Feb-
ntary 2OO2 when 38-
year-old Wall Street
Journal reporter
Daniel Pearl was kid-
napped by terrorists
in Pakistan and bru-
tally murdered. Footage of his
execution spread worldwide via
the Internet, giving the tragedy
a macabre 2Ist-century spin.
But the film'AMighty Heart," based on
the memoir of his widow, feltow journal-
ist Mariane Pearl, offers a story of hope
rather than hate Opening Friday, it shows
Mariane - played by Angelina Jolie -
six months pregnant and su[ounded by
strangers, people of differ ent faiths and
backgrounds. all coming together to try to
rescue Daniel after his kidnapping
Even in despair, Mariane finds some-
thing positive - linking her cry of pain
at the news of Daniel's death to the cries
of pain and happiness while laler giving
birth to their son, Adam Even in the dark-
esl moments. Mariane insists on seeing
light That, above aU, is what drove Jolie
to be involved
"Mariane, under the most extraordi-
nary circumstances, remained very fo-
cused on even having sympathy for the
other side, even after they did that to her
husbmd," says Jolie, interuiewed at thec.,l

cCmnes Film Festival last month "And
I'm sure she felt all that we would ex-
pect her to feel But somehow, on top of
that, she managed to rise above it "
Jolie and her partnet Brad
Pitt, had optioned the book
when it was in galleys to
develop as a film
The two have used
their lives to further
their causes (when Pitt
went to Africa, he took
Diane Sawyer and ABC
with him, deciding that if
cameras are going to follow
him everywhere, he might as
well get them to look at some of the
world's problems) After Huricme Ka-trina, the couple purchased a home in
still-devastated New Orleans The deci
sion by Jolie to give birth to her daugh-
ter, Shiloh, now a year old, in Namibia,
made worldwide headlines
Now they're tuming their art
toward life with "A Mighty
Heart." Yes, the film will re-
mind Hollywood that, de-
spite "Alexander" and the
2005 summer hit "Mr and
Mrs Smith," Jolie is a seri-
ous, Oscar-winning actress -
7 but she has higher goals.
"I hope heoplel read Mari-
ane's book, first of all," says the 32
year-old actress "I hope they basically
get to know her and I hope they look ut</p>
<p>efore the movie of "A lvtighty Heart," and even before
the book, actress Angelina Jolie and reporter N4ariane
Pearl reached out to one anothe[ Pearl's story - a
woman in Pakistan pregnant with her first child suffers
the nightmare scenario of watching as her journalist
huslland is kidnapped and publically murdered - had riveted
people across the globe. Daniel Pearl's beheading was a
flashpoint of politics and inhumanity, cruelty and terrorism
Jolie saw a single mother clinging to hope amid despair
"Their friendship predates the film and the book,,' says
"Mighty Heart" co-producer Dede Gardner, who runs plan B.
Brad Pitt's production company. Pitt had bought Mariane pearl's
book as a movie project prior to Jolle's first meeting the actor on
2005's "Mr and Mrs Smith"
"They shtre similaf [views] about how they live their lives
and how they parent their kids. And they were both single moms
lat the time, Jolie had a year-old adopted son, N,4addoxl; it was a
very natural union. And that got reinforced as they got to know
each other befte["
Director t\,4ichael Winterbottom saw lolie embody her friend
on-camera and o1f
'Angelina seemed to have the same relationship to the other
actors on the set that Mariane had to the Deople in the house
lin Pakistan],'' says Winterbottom- "Everyone in the house with
l,4ariane said to me that Mariane really brought together the team
and made them feel good about what they were doing That's
what Angelina did on the set We had a lot of nonprofessional
actors from Pakistan, people from lndia, Britain, America - and
she always behaved like she was absolutely one ofthe team and
created a really friendly, family atmosphere on the set"
Watching iolie and Pearl side by side when the movie
premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, it's evident how
protective and proud Jolie is of Pearl and her ability to send
out a message of hope and compassion in the wake of her
husband's murder. And when the two women are together, as
they were at Cannes, their similarities become clealFru)

o3"When | first met Angelina, it was with
Mariane," says Winterbottom. "We spent two or
three days talking. I saw how close they were, and
how clearly Mariane wanted her to play the part They
seemed to trust each other, and that was a lcrucial] starting point.,,
In terms of her physical performance, perhaps the trickiest
aspect of the role for lolie was Pearl's accent. which combines
Cuban, English and her native French into its own unique sound.
"l studied her accent," says Jolie- "lt's a really hard accent. And
the way she speaks - she has a rhlthm. tt was stange because Iwas breaking down the voice of a friend "
But Jolie did much more than simply mimic pearl
(and in fact admits she's too shy to do the accent in
front of her); she got to know her emotions, her way of
seeing the world And Pearl's approval of the film, Jolie says,
was the most impoftant asoect of it all for her
"l do see more her than me now," says .Jolie about watchlng
the frlm. "But maybe that's because t\,4ariane told me she
thought it was good She has given me her blessing." a

Danny's old afticles and read about him
"But also I think there rs a bigger mes-
sage in this We are at a time in our lives
where there is so much fear and there is
so much anger And it's hard for people to
calm down enough lo focus on having a
dialogue and understanding the ftlll infor-
mation, and tlylng to have a real compre-
hensive approach to f,ndsolutions And I
think Marime is a great example of that "
For director Michael .winter bottom
('Welcome to Sarajevo," "The Road to
Guantanamo"), the goal was to have a
documentary-like focus on the facts of
what happened in the tense days when
Daniel might still have been saved
"We talked to other people who were
linvolved]," says Winterbottom "But Mar-iane did a great job of telling the story in "
the book She gave us the story inside her
house of this small group of people who
became friends, and just enough of the in-
vestigation and what Pakistan was like "
As for Jolie, being faithful to Mariane's
story was easy.
"The book is beautiful," she says "Dan-
uy was very much in love with Mariane,
and Mariane was very much in love with
Damy. They both would have been great
parents togetheL He spoke to her tummy
Iand their soon-to-be-born child] probably
every day she was pregnilt, and notjust
the day he left "
Jolie sincerely hopes the film's blunt^
ness about the facts of the case won't im-
pede her desire to continue humanitarianefforts in the Middle East Longbe-
fore the film was in the works, she
and Pitt visited Pakistan after a dev-
astating earthquake, in the hope of
refocusing media attention on that
country's plight
"I think it's a very balanced film,
md I don't think t here's any rea-
son lo feel that any one group is go-
ing to be so upset about this and feel
that way," says Jolie "It does make
me want to go back there all the
more, and I miss it I've been there
three times and have a deep love
for that part of the world, and I'm
very saddened to see how every day
it seems to be breaking more md
nlore apart." a=
