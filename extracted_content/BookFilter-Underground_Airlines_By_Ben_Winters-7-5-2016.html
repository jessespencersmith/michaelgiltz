What We Say
Recently I found myself reading three unrelated books that each toy with our world to give new insight into slavery and the
persistent prejudice that poisons society. First, I was late to Paul Beatty's corrosively funny novel "The Sellout," in which ayoung black man in contemporary LA unintentionally gets a slave and then intentionally reintroduces segregation. It's an
unsparing and compassionate all at the same time. Beatty's book is a satire, but don't think of the comforting distance of
"Gulliver's Travels" -- think "A Modest Proposal." Next came Colson Whitehead's upcoming novel "Underground Railroad,"which is scrupulously accurate and believable about life as a slave..until the Underground Railroad is revealed to be aShare This Book

<p>literal underground railroad and our reality is upended. With the slightest shift in reality, Whitehead condenses the next 140
years of Jim Crow and eugenics and the KKK and systemic brutality, making it shockingly real and surprising all over again.
It's a masterpiece. And now here comes Ben Winters' "Underground Airlines." It presents an alternate reality novel, a US in
which four states held onto slaves in a great compromise after Lincoln was assassinated before taking office. The time istoday and our hero is a slave catcher, a black man with a chip in his spine that makes him the toy and tool of thegovernment. He's forced to hunt down escaped slaves because anything -- anything -- is preferable to returning to thatnightmarish world. Winters' novel is fresh and well-thought out and gripping as we wonder if our hero can actually be a
hero. It stumbles a tad toward the end when Winters reveals an even deeper conspiracy; like Hitchcock always suggested,
the vaguer one is about the MacGuffin, the better. To this sci-fi buff, the "reveal" seemed banal and not terribly convincing.But that doesn't discount the way he creates an anti-hero we fully empathize with, not to mention a world so littledifferent from our own that you wonder if it's different at all. And surely that was the point. -- Michael Giltz
