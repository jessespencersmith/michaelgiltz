alone. Check out the grosses below, followed by my thoughts on the week , a list of the
hit films of 2025 and finally brief notes for every film on the chart, in case you ’re
wondering what that hit from India or France or South Korea is actually a bout.

Bold: movies that have or likely will triple their reported budgets. T hat's my
standard for a movie being a box office hit from theatrical alone. Ma ny films will be
profitable for a studio even if they don't triple their reported budg et, thanks to home
rentals, sales of BluRay, cable, streaming and the like. Still, the movies that are hits
from theatrical alone are worth celebrating.
ANALYSIS
A star is born? Actor Glenn Powell enjoyed lots of buzz for his run o f hits starting
with Top Gun: Maverick, followed by the romantic comedy Anyone But You, the Netflix
film Hit Man (which he co-wrote and produced) and the action movie Twisters. He’s a
star, says Hollywood, which is desperate for bankable leading m en.
Well, here’s another. Jack Quaid has not one but two hit films in theaters right now.
Companion is a film about “companion robots” that veers into some wild territory and
the new action comedy Novocaine is a thriller…that also veers into some wacky
territory. Quaid is key to both. Your quote just went up, Jack!*
So it’s not all bad news, even though North America remains in a slumber , with
grosses for the weekend the lowest of 2025…so far.
Speaking of the Quaids, dad Dennis surely enjoyed the news that Universa l plans
international distribution of his biopic Reagan. That seemed like questionable timing
for a movie that only played in the US and a few small territories li ke Estonia and
Poland last year. Then I realized it’s apparently just a deal for rig hts to rent and sell the
flick for home consumption. By the way, the trades call the film a sleeper hit. Actually,
it had a budget of $25mb and grossed $30m, so that’s what I’d call a flop.3/24/25, 2:39 PM BOX OFFICE: CHINA'S "NE ZHA 2" DOMINATES AGAIN
https://michaelgiltz390212.substack.com/p/chinas-ne-zha-2 -dominates-again 4/14</p>
<p>China’s Ne Zha 2 isn’t a flop, of course, but one of the biggest hit films of all time. It’s
the sequel to an animated movie which proved wildly popular in China, but made
almost no money anywhere else. Really, it was for lack of trying, s ince it wasn’t
released in many other countries. We’ve seen films from India and South Korea and
Japan and any other country you can name play successfully all over the world.  Yes, Ne
Zha 2 is based on Chinese mythology unfamiliar to anyone not Chinese. But so what? A
misbehaving imp is a misbehaving imp! It’s not like some of China’s  recent jingoistic
flag waving films or frankly the adulatory biopic Reagan one assumes will be of little
interest in any other country. Ne Zha 2 is a family friendly animated flick.
So it’s welcome if overdue news that the film has been sold to 37 terri tories in Europe,
with “previews” this week and openings in the UK and Ireland for s tarters on March
21. What took them so long?
Finally, Warner Bros. is in disarray, as the studio once known f or being friendly to
talent struggles to find its footing at the box office. They trie d to be pals with auteurs
by taking on Bong Joon Ho’s Mickey 17, but it’s looking like an expensive flop. At the
same time, they keep orphaning films for tax purposes, like Batgirl and the animated
film Coyote Vs. Acme. Then they abandoned The Day The Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes
Movie, a well-reviewed, modestly budgeted cartoon they couldn’t be bothered t o
release and just sold off. To rub salt in the wounds, the week it come s out we discover
Warner Bros. has dumped all the classic Looney Tunes shorts from its streaming
service HBO Max. Synergy much?
Coming this week: Jonathan Majors on the comeback trail (too soon?)  with his
acclaimed indie Magazine Dreams; the 47th horror flick of the year so far, Locked
starring Bill Skarsgård and Anthony Hopkins and Disney’s live action remake of Snow
White. These retreads basically print money for Disney, even though they’re invariably
pointless exercises in recreating already classic films done right in  animation. This
one could be the exception. The original Snow White is a landmark film and gorgeously
animated. But the characters Snow White and Prince Charming are bl andly drawn and
performed. The seven dwarfs steal the show of course, but this one migh t actually
benefit from being reimagined. Bambi? No. Snow White? Yes.3/24/25, 2:39 PM BOX OFFICE: CHINA'S "NE ZHA 2" DOMINATES AGAIN
https://michaelgiltz390212.substack.com/p/chinas-ne-zha-2 -dominates-again 5/14</p>
<p>*An actor’s “quote” is the salary they expect to get on a new project. T he bigger the hit
they’re in, the more they ask for the next film. Strangely, even if a film is a flop, they
don’t suddenly ask for less.
NOTE: Last week Anora reported a post-Oscar bump of $6m worldwide, for a total of
$54m and counting. This week, all the outlets pulled back a bit. “Di d we say $54m?
Make that $52m.” Ok! The Italian smash There’s Still Tomorrow was at $52m last week,
but course corrected to $50m this week. And I’m Still Here jumped to $35m last week,
while this week everyone said, “Make that $34m.” In contrast, A Complete Unknown is
boasting an extra $6m in its total worldwide grosses this week. T hese adjustments
aren’t necessarily gamesmanship or nefarious; sometimes international box office
takes a while to trickle in, so numbers get updated long after th e money was made. So
when you see the box office numbers here bouncing around a bit, just keep in m ind: it
ain’t me, babe.

NOTES
mb = a film's budget in millions of US dollars; ww = worldwide
1. Ne Zha 2– Reported $80mb. Chinese animated fantasy sequel to the 2019 smash
which cost about $20m and grossed $743m. A spin-off film Jiang Ziya was hobbled
by COVID but grossed $243m. Now we have the direct sequel Ne Zha 2,  which cost
$80m and finds our spunky heroine (based on a famed mythological character
around for centuries) taking on sea monsters. The series is based  on Investiture of
the Gods by Xu Zhonglin from the 16th century.
2. Mickey 17–$120mb for director Bong Joon-ho's slapstick sci-fi comedy. Once
again, a tip of the hat to actor Robert Pattinson for forging a very int eresting
career.3/24/25, 2:39 PM BOX OFFICE: CHINA'S "NE ZHA 2" DOMINATES AGAIN
https://michaelgiltz390212.substack.com/p/chinas-ne-zha-2 -dominates-again 7/14</p>
<p>3. Captain America: Brave New World–$180mb.
4. Black Bag–$50mb for the Steven Soderbergh thriller starring Cate Blanchett and
Michael Fassbender.
5. Novocaine–$18mb for this comic thriller means Jack Quaid is enjoying h is
second hit film of 2025, after the comic sci-fi flick Companion.
6. Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy– $50mb and straight to streaming in the
world's biggest market because? Yes, it's only at $100m. But the film m ade $24m
this week, so even if it drops by 50% next week and the week after and ends up at
$120m, I'm calling it a hit. The more money it makes, the stupider t hey look for
going straight to streaming in North America.
7. Paddington in Peru–$90mb? Sadly, three times is not the charm artistic ally or
commercially for this once-perfect franchise.
8. The Monkey -- $10m reported budget means this adaptation of a Stephen King
short story is a box office winner right out of the gate. Cheap horror films a re
money in the bank... but 2025 has so many I have to assume audiences will become
sick and tired of them any minute now. Not forever, not all of t hem, but surely the
surfeit of slasher flicks will prove too much of a good thing. Jus t not yet.
9. A Complete Unknown–$60mb+ for this Bob Dylan biopic? That's a lot of money
for a film about Dylan going electric at Newport. I mean, I wanted to see it but I'm
a Dylan fanatic. But grossing $180m worldwide seems highly unlikely t o me, if not
impossible. (Do other countries give a toss about this? Is Chalame t a big enough
draw for this story? I’m not sure.) I'm glad it was made, but it wa s made for too
much. Like Gladiator II, this will be seen as a commercial success, but it's not.
UPDATE: Well, it keeps going and going and maybe Chalamet is a worldwide
draw now, thanks to  Wonka and the Dune films and he can bring in people to a
serious drama like this. More power to him. It's now at $127m. If i t gets close to
$150m (Japan will have to go crazy for it), I'll happily eat crow and cal l it a hit. It's
already a good example of a movie that may not be technically profitable f rom box
office alone but is clearly a financial success story and a valuable tit le in anyone's
library. It will pull in plenty via rentals and sales and cable and  streaming and the
like. Now where's the sequel where Dylan goes born again Christian ? Or the spin-
off telling the story of Joan Baez? Seriously, that one should be don e immediately.3/24/25, 2:39 PM BOX OFFICE: CHINA'S "NE ZHA 2" DOMINATES AGAIN
https://michaelgiltz390212.substack.com/p/chinas-ne-zha-2 -dominates-again 8/14</p>
<p>10. Dog Man– A reported $40mb. It's always good to gross your budget on opening
week. Plus, the books are funny, the reviews are good, the audienc e response is
great and it has the rest of the world to open in. So get ready for Dog Man 2.
11. The Day The Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie–$15mb for this orphaned
Warner Bros. cartoon. Come on, Porky and Daffy! Make WB look foolish.
12. Mufasa: The Lion King– $200mb.
13. Detective Chinatown 1900– $125mb at least? This is the fourth in a wildly popular
buddy comedy mystery series. Think oh, Rush Hour? 48 Hours?  Each film cost more
than the one before and grossed more. Since we're on film #4 and it's a period
movie set in San Francisco, it's safe to assume this cost more t han #3, which cost
$117m and grossed $686m worldwide. I mean, $150mb is probably more realistic,
at least, but even at that level it's still a hit. Oh and clues in this one indicate the
next film in the series will be set in London. So, Detective Chinatown 1920, here we
come .
14. Conclave– a reported $20mb for this Vatican thriller means this is a hit. Thi s is
exactly the sort of film that can play and play in theaters.
15. Last Breath–$24mb for this Nicolas Cage deep-sea diving drama.
16. Chhaava– $15mb Indian/Hindi language action historical epic.
17. Always Have, Always Will–Chinese comic drama in which a young man finds
inspiration from a sick girl who is always tagging along. The poster echoes "Little
Miss Sunshine."
18. John Wick: Chapter 4– $100mb for this 2023 hit just hitting China. It grossed
$440m worldwide before opening in the Middle Kingdom in March of 2025.
19. Dragon– $4mb for this Indian/Tamil coming of age comedy drama. A young guy
gets too clever with a crooked path to riches, endangering his job, his
relationships and his family's reputation. Can he reform? Does he want  to?
20. The Last Supper–No reported budget for this faith-based indie project about Jesus
and the disciples breaking bread. It hits theaters a little early because in about two
weeks the TV series The Chosen heads to theaters with The Chosen: Last Supper, not
to mention the animated film The King of Kings (with the voices of Oscar Isaac,
Mark Hamill and Pierce Brosnan) on April 11, with Easter itself on April 25.3/24/25, 2:39 PM BOX OFFICE: CHINA'S "NE ZHA 2" DOMINATES AGAIN
https://michaelgiltz390212.substack.com/p/chinas-ne-zha-2 -dominates-again 9/14</p>
<p>21. Moana 2– $150mb. Is the budget lower since it was intended for tv, at first? O r
higher because they had to rethink everything? Disney says it cost $150mb, j ust
like the original. You can bet Dwayne Johnson gets more than his share of
coconuts, but that won't matter with a hit like this.
22. Sonic The Hedgehog 3– $120mb.
23. Companion– A reported $10mb for this sci-fi horror comedy starring Sophie
Thatcher and Jack Quaid. Great reviews means this one should have a long run  at
the box office.
24. Hotline Beijing–No reported budget or info on Chinese film.
25. In The Lost Lands–$55mb reported budget for this fantasy film starring Milla
Jovovich and David Bautista based on a short story by George R.R. Martin. Mayb e
Martin won't be so harsh on the tv series House of Dragons after seeing this.
26. Legend of the Condor Heroes: The Gallants– $30mb per one Chinese source,
called in English Oriental Daily . A wuxia martial arts period adventure film written
and directed by the legendary Tsui Hark. It's based on part of the novel of the same
name by Jin Yong. According to one report it's the highest grossin g wuxia film at
the Chinese box office. That would mean it made more than Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon and every local box office hit. Mostly Hark would be competing
with himself. His budgets bounce up and down, from the massive $200mb for both
The Battle at Lake Changjin 1 and 2 (which he co-directed), and $60mb for some
Detective Dee movies and down to $20mb or $30mb for various other flicks. One
vague Chinese source says it cost $30mb, so I’m tentatively calling it a hit. If they
make a sequel, then I’ll know it was a hit!
27. One of Them Days– $14mb.  It's always good to gross your budget during a film's
opening week. So yea for producer Issa Rae and this comedy starring Keke Palmer
and SZA. (What an opening week for SZA! Her movie opened well and she made
my list of The 250 Best Albums of the 21st Century...So Far.)
28. The Brutalist– $10mb; Adrien Brody in this architect-as-hero period drama. I'm
not a fan of the film but I am delighted to see any passion project th is unlikely
make money. Truly.
29. Heart Eyes–$18mb for rom/com slash horror film.3/24/25, 2:39 PM BOX OFFICE: CHINA'S "NE ZHA 2" DOMINATES AGAIN
https://michaelgiltz390212.substack.com/p/chinas-ne-zha-2 -dominates-again 10/14</p>
<p>30. Attack On Titan The Movie: The Last Attack –No reported budget for this feature
film compilation of final episodes from the Japanese anime tv series. But
essentially, releases like this are all gravy: free promo for the series  a budget that
was already spent to make the new season. So it’s a hit!
31. Becoming Led Zeppelin –Long-gestating doc broke into the Top 10 on opening
weekend, playing on IMAX screens only. In its second weekend, the film has an
excellent hold. This traditional doc (talking heads, conce rt footage) has already
grossed $6m, which is serious money for this type of film. There is no reported
budget, but given all that I know, it seems likely the total was $2mb o r less, so this
is a winner.
32. The Unbreakable Boy–heartwarming family film about little boy who has a rare
bone disease and autism, but also has a zest for life that wins over everyone.
33. National Theatre: Prima Facie– The acclaimed play starring Jodie Comer of Killing
Eve makes $4.4m in China. Heck, the fact that it's shown in China kind of surprises
me.
34. Night of the Zoopocalypse–Scrappy animated comedy about animals tak ing on
zombies at the Zoo.
35. Rule Breakers–$8mb reported budget for the latest faith-based film from Angel
Studios. This one is about an educator who dares to teach young women in
Afghanistan.
36. Opus–A $10mb reported budget for this arty A-24 horror flick about a one-time
pop star turned cult leader (John Malcovich) inviting a journalist (Ayo Edebiri) to
witness his Jonestown-like final performance.

THE CHART AND HOW IT IS COMPILED
This column is a week by week tracking of box office around the world. I c ompile it by
pulling from every possible source: ComScore, Box Office Mojo, Variety, HollywoodT yp e  y our  e m ai l . . .S u b s c r ibe3/24/25, 2:39 PM BOX OFFICE: CHINA'S "NE ZHA 2" DOMINATES AGAIN
https://michaelgiltz390212.substack.com/p/chinas-ne-zha-2 -dominates-again 11/14</p>
<p>Reporter, Deadline, charts for countries like China and India and Sout h Korea,
individual stories in trade or general interest newspapers, Wikipedia and anyone else
discussing box office.
ComScore Weekly Global Box Office Chart
The weekly charts contain the total gross for every movie in theaters around t he world
during the last seven days. Most charts compare the three day grosses (Fri- Sun) of
current releases (ignoring all the money they made from Monday to Thursday) to the
four day grosses of new releases (since most new releases "preview" on Thursday).
Naturally, sometimes movies open on a Wednesday in North America, whic h means
they "preview" on Tuesday. So why not just add up all the money a movie made in the
last seven days, whether it opened on a Tuesday or a Thursday or three week s earlier?
Plus, I look at worldwide box office. Hits appear all over the world , some of them
having a big impact in other territories and some flourishing only at home. B ut they all
mint new stars and directors who often go on to help bigger movies in Hol lywood and
elsewhere. Plus any studio tentpole film depends on the international mar ket, where
they often gross most of their money. So focusing only on North America and ignoring
the rest of the world is just as foolish as ignoring North American grosses and
insisting you only want to know what a movie made in Oklahoma.
How do we arrive at the total gross for a movie over the last seven days? We ta ke the
total worldwide box office we have for a movie, subtract from it the previous w eek's
total worldwide box office...and that's how much it made durin g the past seven days.
Naturally, some territories and movies can fall through the cracks but w e are as up to
date as we can be, given our dependence on other outlets for the basic inf o.
Any movie grossing at least US $1 million will be on here, if we get i nfo on it. Then I
give some thoughts on the box office overall and individual films. Th at's followed by
notes where I give info on each movie, with a focus on films not from Hollywood. So
Despicable Me 4 you know. But a small Korean comedy or French drama? That I'll
identify for you as best I can.
Which movies make the list for The Hit Films of 2025? My rule of th umb is that films
should gross roughly three times as much as their reported budget to be cal led a hit3/24/25, 2:39 PM BOX OFFICE: CHINA'S "NE ZHA 2" DOMINATES AGAIN
https://michaelgiltz390212.substack.com/p/chinas-ne-zha-2 -dominates-again 12/14</p>
<p>from theatrical alone. Some people now say a movie need only make 2 1/2 ti mes as
much as their budget, but I'm sticking with the traditional formula. O f course, we
don't really  know a movie's budget or the cost of advertising or the backroom deals.
And remember, just because a movie isn't a hit from theatrical alone does n't mean
they're losing money. Far from it. So, we can't dive deep into Hollywoo d accounting.
But we can spot the really big hits that will change careers, launch franc hises and
generally pay the bills. It's harder to get a reported budget on i nternational films so I
tend to avoid calling them a hit unless I have info that convinces m e they're a winner.
Also, I include movies from 2024 if they make the majority of their money in 2025.
Finally, I identify the country for non-Hollywood movies to celebrate t he worldwide
movie biz. I indicate the language Indian films were made in to celebrate that
country's diverse industry, which is vibrant and includes more than th e Hindi-
language Bollywood films Westerners knew best.
