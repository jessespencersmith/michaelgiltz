            <p>May 24, 2008Cannes Day Eleven: Spaghetti, I mean"Noodle Westerns"The Good, The Bad and The Weird -- I've seen a good to greatfilm during the last three days of the fest and that's extremelyunusual. With the market shutting down on Wednesday andthe journalists heading out Thursday and Friday, the end of thefest is often saved for space fillers -- movies that round out thefest's lineup (maybe tipping the hat to a region of the world notwell represented) but it almost never contains actually goodmovies unless the film just wasn't ready till then. But I've seen"Il Divo" and "The Class," both of which will be on my best ofthe year list. And now this fun bit of goofiness as one final gift.It's an unabashed homage to Sergio Leone's spaghetti westernsand unlike say Tears of the Black Tiger from a few years ago,this one isn't a sendup but just the best damn western that theKoreans can turn out. Set in Manchuria, it's all about themilitary and rival gangs of crooks racing to get their hands on atreasure map first. At the heart of it all is The Good, a dashingbounty hunter with a way with a rifle; the Bad, a nasty villainwho kills with relish and wants to square off with the others toprove he's the fastest gun around; and the Weird, a goofy ne'erdo well who has stumbled on the map and would like thetreasure but would like even more to stay alive. It's all done in alavish, pop style, like Leone crossed with Tarantino. The actorsare vivid and fun and the modest mix of martial arts and mostlygunplay is satisfying. The finale is a Mexican stand-off -- justlike The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. Lots of humor throughoutand fun over-the-top battles (the military gets thrown in forgood measure). if the finale were a knockout instead of just fine,I'd praise this even more. But it's certainly a lot of fun and a realdelight for the end of the fest.Tomorrow, they repeat all the films in Competition.
