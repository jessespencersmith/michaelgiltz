RESULTS AND RATINGS:  I'm in Champaign,
Illinois for Roger Ebert's film festival, so I didn't get to
watch Idol Gives Back.  But as I predicted, Tim Urban
finally went home. And you know, voters aren't so
wacky. He stayed on the last few weeks because he
gave pretty good performances, despite his vocal
limitations. This week he was bad and he went home.Aaron Kelly and Casey James were both in the bottomthree, with Casey probably wondering why his much
more confident and rock star-ish persona isn't
connecting with fans the way Lee Dewyze's sad sackmumbling does. I'm surprised by Aaron, even though
he's been in the bottom three before. But those who
commented below picked him as vulnerable.
But the big news for me as a TV buff was the fact that Idol  has beaten back a threat from Dancing With
The Stars.  Briefly, with Kate Gosselin on DWTS , that show was beating Idol. This meant Idol's  chance to
make TV history and become the first show to ever rank #1 for six different seasons was in jeopardy.
(Plus, Idol  will be #1 for six seasons in a row!) But last week Idol  beat DWTS  and did it again this week.
On Monday, DWTS  scored 18.93 million viewers. But on Tuesday, Idol  scored 19.14 million (down about
20% from last season, mind you). The DWTS  results show scored 13.45 million while Idol 's results show
reached 18.4 million. More importantly, ratings magnet Kate was eliminated on DWTS . Idol  has beaten
the show two weeks in a row and is heading towards the finale so it should triumph again. And anyonewho thinks reality shows are rigged is crazy: the producers would have LOVED Kate to stay on thatshow.
PERFORMANCE SHOW COVERAGE:  American Idol  gives back and Alicia Keys was the mentor.
She generously showed what a good mentor Adam Lambert was by saying little more than that the
singers should try to connect to the lyrics.

Bump...CASEY JAMES  -- Sang "Don't Stop" by Fleetwood Mac's Christine McVie (please, record with them,
Christine; you don't have to go on tour!). [Thanks to reader dunedin for pointing out my error in crediting
the song to Lindsey Buckingham.] James had some stinging guitar, which echoed note for note the
original. Perfectly good cover but not special, which is what all the judges said. Simon pointed out it's notparticularly tied into the theme of giving back (unless of course you're Bill Clinton). Did Lindsey loanCasey his guitar or was it donated for charity? I can't even imagine him watching the show. (Though I
am delighted that super cool Tracey Thorn of Everything But The Girl is goofily devoted to Cowell's UK
show The X Factor.)
LEE DEWYZE  -- Sang Simon & Garfunkel's "The Boxer," which is a wonderful Paul Simon tune that's
just on the edge of dated, but in an endearing, earnest, collegiate Sixties sort of way. It was no surprise he
skipped the line about visiting the whores on Seventh Ave (a shame, since I grew up on Seventh Ave inPompano Beach, Florida and my sisters and I always jokngly cheered at that part). Better than James,
but it was a bit draggy (like the song, to be fair), though the judges raved.
TIM URBAN  -- Sang "Better Days" by the Goo Goo Dolls. Finally, the wheels come off for cute as a
button Tim. Painfully bad vocals but he's ready for the CW pilot season, isn't he?
AARON KELLY  -- Sang "I Believe I Can Fly" by R. Kelly. Way too familiar a choice for a song overdone
on the show. And yet in a complete reversal of Tim, Aaron got back on track and gave a very good
performance after weeks of seeming lost -- and the country twang made the song actually sound fresh.Just in time to put him back in contention for the finale.
SIOBHAN MAGNUS  -- Sang "When You Believe," a duet between Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston
from the animated film The Prince of Egypt.  It won the Oscar for Best Song, but like the film is
thoroughly forgettable even as you're listening to it. Still, Siobhan hit a few notes in the way Idol  viewers
enjoy which might be enough to keep her from the bottom. Her post-song chat didn't help. When you
don't seem to be having fun, people don't have fun watching you.
MICHAEL LYNCHE  -- Sang the Nickelback tune "Hero," which I don't know in the least so I have
nothing to compare it to. (I'm traveling so I wasn't able to buy it and download it to hear the original.)
Kind of anonymous but had some energy.
CRYSTAL BOWERSOX  -- Sang "People Get Ready," by the Impressions and covered by just about
everyone else since. Thank the Lord! After weeks of coasting, Crystal used no instrument, sang a cappella
to start, looked supremely confident and knocked it out of the park. And then oh my god overwhelmed by
emotion she broke down to show a little humanity! Perfect timing and no one else is even close. No ideawhat Simon said because my recording cut off but I'm sure he raved.
The bottom three: Casey james, Tim Urban and Siobhan Magnus, with Tim and Siobhan in the bottom
two and Tim going home. What do you think?

200 FansI just don't know what to say about all these people claiming Siobhan is a great singer. She is a
TERRIBLE singer -- if you're looking for a, you know, STAR. She doesn't connect to the song or theaudience. Her head voice is CRAP -- that whole SONG was in her head voice, and it was incrediblypainful to listen to. It was NASAL in the extreme.
I cannot wait till she goes home. She's simply dreadful.
I find myself wondering sometimes .... what would the judges have said about _________. And fill in
the blank with some big names, like Bonnie Raitt
I thought, for instance, that some of the contestant s were better a few weeks ago than Usher and
Ruben and Who Diddy Dis Time? And what would they say about Taylor Swift or Justine Bieber? (And yes, I put the "e" on there on
purpose.) Kara probably would have said Christina and Madonna just don't know who they are. Orimagine Bob Dylan on Idol when he was 19. (or now)
I think Bob Dylan would have been great in a way. He was very handsome as a young guy,
very quick with a quip, loved the camera and knew how to play to it. Plus he has a deep
love of many genres but can't help but be himself. Taylor Swift of course would not havemade it past Hollywood week. Thanks for reading.
IDOL Experts are saying ratings PLUMMET now that TIM URBAN is gone. Check out the story itspretty compelling - LOOK at page too. ITS looks like IDOL makes out more then the charity
http://bit .ly/chVsoe
Looks like Crystal tears were crocodile too http://bit .ly/dgLZ7h
Crystal has been my choice from the beginning. This is my kind of music.Crystal is also a great songwriter . Check some of her original music on YouTube - Farmer's
Daughter, Mama, Holy Toledo, Hellbent. This isn't bubblegum music. I just hope 19 Entertainm ent
doesn't try to fit her into the pop music box. Wouldn't that be ironic after all the judges' comments
about how she knows herself, is true to herself.

See if you think Farmer's Daughter and Mama may be auto-biogr aphical. If they are, this could
account for her reserved demeanor and aura of sadness.
Here's an article from the Toledo Blade with a lot of background informatio n about Crystal.
http://www .toledobla de.com/art icle/20100 321/ART10/ 3210307/-1 /RSS05
Last night my absolute favorite was Jeff Beck and Joss Stone - like I said, this is my kind of music.
Check their version of People Get Ready - http://www .youtube.c om/watch?v =P7ECdYboO VA
And of course, there's always the Beck/Rod Stewart version from 1985.
Yes, Joss and Jeff were the best outside performanc e Idol has had in ages. Simply great. 
As I said below, check out Eva Cassidy's version of People Get Ready: http://www .youtube.c om/watch?v =WeU9MZc0d Gw&feature =related
Or Eva's incredible version of Somewhere Over the Rainbow:http://www .youtube.c om/watch?v =Ce-5OWBNG Nw
I can't believe you mentioned the great Eva Cassidy. I have a couple of her CDs.One is Live at Blues Alley. People Get Ready is on it along with Stormy Monday,Bridge Over Troubled Water, Take me to the River. It's a great album.
Such a shame she died so young but it's a testament to how great she was that
people are still discoverin g her and buying her music.
I think I'll be listening to some Eva Cassidy today.

I must be among those with no musical taste because I cannot stand listening to Siobhan.
I don't mean that I don't like her song choices, or that she doesn't connect, etc, I mean her voicebothers me.She sings in her nose, and screeches at the end.How is that a good voice?
As far as Crystal, I think she is fun to watch and listen to. She is comfortabl e performing , sounds
good, and is cute. I own all of Raitt's albums, though, so that makes sense.
I agree about the nasal quality in her singing and thought she'd lose fans by her dull, very
uncool and unquirky choice of such an anonymous, boring song as the (admitting ly Oscar
winning) tune from The Prince of Egypt. But the closer we get to the end, the moreimportant it is to reach out to the casual viewer. Siobhan at the very least has to look likeshe's having fun and reveling in her quirkiness . That was one thing you never doubted
about Adam. He was having a blast.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST

 FollowNo, you're completely sane and you have fine taste. Siobhan is so unbearably nasal it
actually hurts to listen to her. These people lauding her as a great singer simply haven't afreakin' clue.
Thank you for correcting us. In the future, we'll all check with you to find out whowe're allowed to enjoy and who we must find unbearable . Please forgive us, Your
Highness, for having our own opinions.

I agree about Lindsey Buckingham , but "Don't Stop" is a Christine McVie song.
Yikes! Thanks for the correction .
Casey let me down with another fluff performanc e after the fantastic Jealous Guy. I just re-watched
Jealous Guy and it is stunningly good and heartfelt.
Agree with you Michael, Buckingham is an amazing fingerstyl e guitarist. Just awesome. Casey did
do a great cover but it was in no way original or special. I think LB has to sign off on the song so in
that sense he gave his approval for it to be sung. Unlike many artists who refuse to let Idol sing theirmusic (i.e. Madonna --- who allowed it for Glee -- but there you go).
As much as I appreciate Crystal I feel no connection to her as I have done in the past.Carrie Underwood is just amazing. For me she was the biggest star there on Idol Gives Back.
I don't like Underwood, I think she's a result of lots of hype, white voting, and CMA support
on the nashville circuit. If music was just about the people like in the old days, she'd be athird rate CM singer.
Blige singing Stairway was blasphemou s. Its not artistry its like urinating on the American
flag of rock fantasy. She sang it like it had more than a single note message which it
doesnt. The beauty of that song isnt the message, its the unexplaina ble. The fantasy of
fable rock anthems and she presuppose d to capsulize the lyric and song with a gospel like
soul rendition. Led Zepplin and gosbel are about as far apart as fire and ice. I almostvomited. It came up in my mouth. The same way it did when Taylor Swift sang her tritesuperficia l song with Stevie Nicks. 
Crystal cried at seeing her father in the audience and the song meant something to herpersonally and you said you didnt feel a connection ?......... .....what are you a robot.HUFFPOST SUPER USER

 FollowWe are on the same page on all of this. Underwood drives me nuts..her voice is
like fingernail s on a chalkboard to me, but last night she was better than usual.
Compared to Annie Lennox, though.... not even in the ball park.

...STH is nothing holy, it's just a song...
...and Mary sung it to perfection ...
...truth hurts...
Frankly, I feel they should end this farce, give Crystal the trophy,(si c), bring out Bonnie Raitt and do
an hour long concert. Or at least tell us when we can see them in concert this year. 
I do not need to see or hear any of the others again. it is what it is. Siobhan should be really big on broadway.
Unless her scheduling doesn't work out, I'm sure they're trying to book Bonnie Raitt for thefinale.
Crystal is by far and away a huge artist and performer. I'd pay money to see her concert and buyher music. She's a breath of fresh air for music.
Lee is a close second but his stage presence and lack of performanc e will lock him into 2nd place.
Either way I'd buy his music and pay to see him on stage.Sioban is a dark horse imo. She CAN be the next "new" talent to hit the industry, like Pink or Alanis
did it but with some work she could be the next Cindy Lauper meets Celine Dione.
Aaron will be a huge singing star but not for several years and probably on the CMA circuit.
Casey will be a star but whether or not he's going to "new" to rock will be up to him. 
Mike has a narrow R&B sound and he'll be good at Gospel but he's not going to win Idol.
Tim - he knows he's lucky to be there and he's making the best of it with what he has to market. I
wish him well and I look for his songs to hit the radio. 
I'm pissed about my favorite being cut, Lilly. She was on fire. I'd buy tickets to see her live anytime.If Crystal gets booted before the end, I'm done. I'll never watch Idol again.I'm still pissed they let MJ Blige sing Led Zeps Stairway to Heaven with a soul styling. BLASPHEMY!Permalink  | Share it

443 Fans!! HO !!
Thanks for the rundown, but I'd be careful about name-calli ng Mary J. Blige. She's tough! :)
...Mary sung that song and WORKED IT!...
...are you just mad because and RnB singer covered a rock song......give credit where credit is due and deal with it...HO!!!
I agree with almost all of your assessment s. Including Lilly, who should still be in the
running. (I skipped MJ Blige and some others; sorry I missed Annie who I love. Joss and
Jeff were great.)
But I don't think we'll hear Tim on the radio. He only lasted this long because the tweens
and teeny boppers love his hair and smile. No talent.
I am really blown away from how lame the list of "Inspirati onal songs" were that the kids could
choose from. Here are some that were not on the list:Defying Gravity, In the Arms of the Angels, I Don't Want to Be, To Where You Are as sung by JoshGrobin,Joy ful Joyful, the Pretender' s Hymn to Her, Idina Menzel's I Stand, Dusty Springfiel d's Born
That Way. .. the list goes on. Can you add more?
That's a great point. "Don't Stop?" GooGoo Dolls? An awful tune from The Prince OfEgypt? Not good song selections at all.
I agree. Song selections were horrible and what an opportunit y missed...t here are so many
of them. They should all study the song and delivery of Annie Lennox.

16 FansI taped the show and watched Crystal twice. She had no tears, or even moisture in her eyes so my
take is that the "emotion" was fake. She is a great singer but sound the same on every song. WhenI compare her to Siobhan Magnus, the latter's tone and range is superior.
Why are they so down on Siobhan. She is great. I thought the arrangemen t was too shortened
however. If she sang the full version of the song, it would have been better.
You need to get Hi-Def, Crystal was definitely crying. Maybe as much for the tune as the
fact Ryan Seabiscuit sandbagged her this week and told the world he kept her from walkingoff the show, when apparently she just had a down day where she was missing her son.
And Siobhan was my #1 early on, but she has gone off the rails. Her style has become SO
mannered with unnatural vibrato, her delivery completely uninspirin g. I don't think taking a
rocker-chi ck and forcing her to sing this kind of drivel is helping at all. I wasn't the biggest
Lambert fan, but at least he knew who he is as an artist, as does Crystal. Siobhan doesn't
have a clue.
Never has a group of songs been less inspiratio nal. Why don't they have a "Be You" week
where they can sing whatever they want, just like Hollywood week. That would give you a
lot better reflection of what their records would sound like rather than making them singsgenres they don't like, or sappy theme nights like "Inspirati onal".
Although watching Big Mike ignore 5 million inspiratio nal R&B tunes, only to perform a
goofy song from "Spiderman ", and then defend it by saying it's about heroes, was almost
worth the laugh.
You have a point about Siobhan running off the rails. She is trying to please thejudges, not herself. I was hoping she would choose that song from the 80's madepopular by Whitney, you know the one with the lyric "children are our future, teachthem well and let them lead the way." Since she has so many young relatives, Ithought that the song would be meaningful to her.
My favorite song and the one that brought her to my attention was the Chris Isaak
son she sang early on. Even though she was fabulous, Simon didn't get that oneeither.
Big Mike doesn't have the range or tone of a truly great R and B singer. I like
Casey, and he will be a remembered Idol. I think the final three will be Siobhan,Crystal and Casey.

I agree, but what are ya gonna do? The kids love their piercings.
wow, interestin g posts. i never thought about the christian angle keeping poor singers around way
past their expiration date. that explains why tim urban is still on the show.
i do not understand why Sioban is being pan by the judges. she is still the best singer on the show. Casey and Lee are are the same musical type, but the judges never criticizes Lee for standing andplaying his guitar like they do Casey. Casey is being held back by the format of the show. i get theimpression that he wants to let loss on his guitar, play a long solo, and jump around the stage.Lee butchered the lyrics for "the Boxer" and i did not really cared for it. I hope tim urban goes hometonight, because voice was not in tune.
Thanks for reading. There's a long history on reality shows of people getting a boost fromdifferent passionate fanbases, whether it's Idol or Nashville Star or any show where fansvote. getting a prayer chain going to help out a Christian contestant is fine just like it'snatural for Mexican Americans to support one of their own or Koreans to get excited by oneof theirs.
I get tired of the judges trying to say "Do Something different! ". They are the type of people who
would have Stevie Nicks on there and tell her she needs to "Break out of that whole Stevie nicksthing yo, do some Mariah!" Or people who would have Lady Ga Ga on there and tell her tosing....we ll some Mariah. I'm not really a Casey James fan, but if playing the guitar and singing that
type of song is what he does it would be stupid of him to get up there and do a song by Justinbieber. This season is beyond boring.
Ha! Funny post. I think "do something different" is their catch phrase this year as a
substitute for "that wasn't good." Crystal does basically the same thing every week and they
love her. It just has to be something they like.
I've been waiting for one of the singers to snap back at the judges when they sayon one hand: 'omg you ruined a classic, why did you mess with a classic' and thenon the other hand say: 'you didn't make it your own, you didn't add anything new' .WTH? 
That's probably why I tape the show and fast forward thru EVERYTHING except
the singing..e verything. I don't want to see Ellen with the deer in the headlightsPermalink  | Share it

started on Simon who says, 'I'm not being rude' when he means he doesn't MEAN
to be rude, but...he's rude. And Ryan..plea se...enoug h with the dramatic crap, and
the posing in a different place in the audience every 14 seconds. JUst stand upthere and be an emcee, the show isn't about you.
I think Idol jumped the proverbial shark for me two seasons ago and I still haven't
gotten off it altogether . But I'm getting there!
Sorry Mike, 
Mr. Lynche will be going ho9me tonight. 
As far as Crystal is concerned I was wrong. This woman is good. I still got my eye on Casey to win the whole thing.
Yeah I agree about Mike going home. I couldn't believe they saved him
I wouldn't be surprised at all if Lynche went home (haven't watched yet). The only
ones that would surprise me are Crystal Lee and Casey.
