9/02/2005 02:30:00 PMUK's Independent captures the brewing storm of criticism thatis building around Bush on virtually EVERY level -- his lack ofpreparedness, his initial indifference to the unfolding disasterand his current ineffective actions. It's a humdinger.The Biloxi Sun Herald in Mississippi...surveyed the disasteraround its editorial offices and asked: "Why hasn't everyable-bodied member of the armed forces in southMississippi been pressed into service?"As when the Asian tsunami hit last year, Mr Bush foundhimself on holiday at his Texas ranch when disaster struck.As with the tsunami, he was soon in the firing line forreacting slowly - he spent Monday on a fundraising tour ofthe American West - and failing to provide adequateleadership. As survivors complained of a lack of water, foodand medical supplies yesterday, fingers from across thepolitical spectrum were pointed at the White House.Experts on the Mississippi Delta...noted that flood-controlspending for south-eastern Louisiana had been choppedevery year that Mr Bush has been in office, that hurricaneprotection funds have also fallen, and that the local armycorps of engineers has also had its budget cut.And here's Reuters on how the world is stunned at watching Bush andthe US struggle to deal with this disaster.
