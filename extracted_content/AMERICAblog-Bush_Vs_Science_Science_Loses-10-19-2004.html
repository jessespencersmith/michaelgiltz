10/19/2004 05:22:00 PMHere's a good, meaty New York Times article about how Bush hasturned science into a partisan issue. It's a little wishy-washy at first(some of the scientists who criticize Bush are -- gasp! -- Democrats).But then it gets into the facts and shows how many, many scientistswho have served both Republican and Democratic adminsitrationsover the decades think Bush ignores science and is trying to subvertscientific information for political purposes.A big battleground? Global warming, where scientific studies andgroup after group insisted that the evidence for human impact onglobal warming was overwhelming but Bush lied anyway and said thejury was still out."Several dozen interviews with administration officials and withscientists in and out of government, along with a variety ofdocuments, show that the core of the clash is over instances in whichscientists say that objective and relevant information is ignored ordistorted in service of pre-established policy goals. Scientists wereessentially locked out of important internal White House debates;candidates for advisory panels were asked about their politics as wellas their scientific work; and the White House exerted broad controlover how scientific findings were to be presented in public reports ornews releases."Then there's the overt politicizing of what should be non-partisanscientific advisory panels."Despite three years of charges that it is remaking scientific andmedical advisory panels to favor the goals of industry or socialconservatives, the White House has continued to ask some panelnominees not only about their political views, but explicitly whetherthey support Mr. Bush."If Albert Einstein were still around, he'd probably be locked up inGuantanamo Bay.
