Ok, first a rundown of the results show and then
the controversy. Ryan Seacrest announced they'draised $60 mil so far. I assume after all is said anddone they'll raise more than last year, which is theJerry Lewis Standard of Success for a telethon.
Brooke White, David Cook and David Archuleta
were all pronounced safe. Then Jordin Sparks dida fine duet with Chris Brown of her smash hit "NoAir." I think Jordin is going to prove a much more
durable artist than those who dismissed her as a teeny-bopper will expect. She's already hadseveral huge pop hits (including "No Air" and "Tattoo") and sure her album has only gone gold butpeople aren't buying albums right now. She looked great and sounded great.
Then Jason Castro was safe. Is this guy gonna slide his way in mellow fashion all the way to the
final three? Sure feels like it. He's barely placed a foot wrong. Ryan teased Kristy Lee Cook before
admitting she had avoided the bottom three -- where she lives -- and was safe.
THE BOTTOM THREE  -- Syesha Mercado, Carly Smithson and Michael Johns. I had predicted
Syesha and Carly and Brooke, with Syesha sadly going home. We saw promos from all three
Presidential candidates with John McCain pretending he watches the show (joking about Simonwhen he wasn't joking about voting scandals in Florida and Michigan) and Barack Obama provingthe only one to stand next to the American flag.
Then Boom! Ryan dropped the news that Michael Johns was going home  so abruptly that people

<p>Michael Giltz: American Idol "Shout to the Lord" Controversy and Results
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem-jesus-c_b_96176.html [4/5/2009 7:11:53 PM]weren't quite sure for a moment what had happened. Very annoyingly, Ryan then reminded us that
last year they had not sent anyone home before pausing dramatically...and then telling Michael he
was going home anyway. They should have made clear at the top of the show that someone was
going home. Using it to torture the loser was especially mean. Syesha really dodged a bullet (and
I've got a crush on her) while Carly was convinced the entire night she was going home and was the
only one to really cry at the end. Then Michael sang a defiant "Dream On." This wasn't really a
shock. Was Michael Johns going to make the finals? Nope. So then going home before the finals
(in whatever order) isn't a shock or a scandal.
THE "JESUS" CONTROVERSY -- Confession: I fast-forwarded through Idol Gives Back
because life is too short to watch telethons. I caught the kids singing "Seasons of Love" from Rent
but apparently missed another finale where they sang "Shout To The Lord," an evangelical
Christian tune written by Darlene Zschech and covered by Ruben Studdard . The first line of the
wildly popular tune is " My Jesus, my Savior."  On the telethon show, the lyrics were changed from
"My Jesus" to "My Shepherd."
That's their first big mistake. If you're going to sing a gospel tune, sing it. Why change that word?
Just a week earlier, at least two songs by Dolly Parton were performed that mentioned Jesus. Notsurprisingly, some evangelical Christians were annoyed,  debating among themselves whether it
was better than nothing to hear the song with the word "Jesus" dropped and so on.
Bizarrely, they began tonight's show with all the kids singing "Shout To The Lord" AGAIN, this
time reinstating the proper words "My Jesus, my Savior." Big mistake number two and in fact itreally compounded the mistake they made the night before by making the song a groupperformance.
Thursday night was the first time I heard them perform this tune and as a practicing Catholic I was
stunned, annoyed, upset for the performers and angry that this show had stumbled in such astupid way.
Don't get me wrong: during Dolly week I suggested that some day they have a theme week devoted
to songs of faith/gospel, which is practically what Inspirational Week is anyway. I love gospel
music and have dozens of CDs ranging from classics by Mahalia Jackson to the soundtrack to the
terrific documentary Say Amen, Somebody  to the great Marion Williams and more recent artists.
(Not to mention religious music from around the world and many other faiths.) I'm happy to hear
individual singers perform gospel tunes, even if they do come from a more evangelical wing of
Christianity than I adhere to. And of course with the kids free to choose whatever song they want,songs of faith could be anything from the spiritual "Didn't It Rain" to Yusuf Islam/Cat Stevens'"Peace Train" to Jackson Browne's "The Rebel Jesus" to XTC's acerbic "Dear God."  But asking all
the kids to do a group sing on a born-again evangelical Christian number is wrong for manyreasons.
1. It's unfair to the performers who want to win --  Pressuring them to sing an evangelical
number is wrong. Who wants to be revealed as the Idol  who refused to sing a song about Jesus?
Think that might hurt their chances with Middle America? They should never have been put in
that position.
2. It's unfair to the performers of conscience --  I'm a Catholic and that's a tune we would
never sing in Church, though none of its lyrics are of the sort that conflict with my faith. (Though
many evangelical tunes, in fact, do and entire trends in Christian music are embraced by liberalevangelicals, rejected by conservative evangelicals and vice versa.) But what about the Idols  who
aren't Christian? Maybe some of them are Buddhist or agnostic or Jewish or Muslim or god forbid,atheist.
3. It's offensive to the viewers --  I'm a Catholic and I was offended. I don't turn on Idol  to be
converted or evangelized to by the show -- and that's exactly what a group sing-along is. It's a
statement by the show, not individual kids. America is the most religiously diverse country in theworld (and I live in Queens, New York -- the most religiously and ethnically diverse corner of theworld). That's something to celebrate and it also means respecting other faiths and people of nofaith. You don't do that by hijacking Idol  to make all the kids sing about Jesus. Even if each and
every one of them is born again and dying to sing the praises of the Lord, you don't alienate theviewers like me -- and most Americans are not evangelicals -- who don't identity with thatparticular strand of Christianity.

Dropping the "Jesus" from "Shout to the Lord" was a big mistake. Making all the Idol  contestants
sing it together in the first place was an even bigger one. If any individual Idol  wanted to sing it,
fine. But a group sing-along? Wrong. What do you think?

Let's not forget that this is a Fox network and when it behooves them to wrap themselves in the flag
and God they do. Additionally what a joke, they got 60 million in two days with the corporatesponsorship of Exxon/Mobil who extorted over 13 billion last year from the American people. I wouldlike to know how much the major corporations give to relieve the misery they create in the world.Considering that in todays real world you could win 60 milion in any state lottery in which the state getsto keep more than half.

You've got a great name, Michael Gabriel (doesnt get more Christian than that), but I heartilydisagree. While intolerance of other faiths has been quite common throughout the years in
Catholicism and certainly fundamentalist sects, it's by no means an essential part of faith.
Many, many mainstream faiths (including the Catholicism practiced by most Americans and
explored thoughtfully by American theologians) like welcoming Episcopal churches, Reformed
Judaism, Unitarian Universalists, many UCC churches, and so on. One of the world's majorfaiths, Hinduism is tolerant both culturally and theologically towards other faiths, hence theprecept that "Truth is one, but people call it by many names." As a Catholic who embraces aloving God, I'm not theologically trained, but dismiss out of hand the idea of a God who wouldcondemn you to hell just because you were born in India or China and lived a decent, God-fearing life as a Budhist or Hindu. Gandhi is in hell? Many if not most faiths would scoff at theidea. For me, it is essential to my faith to be loving and respectful towards other faiths and themore I learn about them (even the ones I disagree with) the more I can respect them. Theidea of disdaining other faiths that spring from the same Abrahamic tradition seemsmisguided. I know the Pope believes Catholicism is the one true way to God, but he ismeeting with Muslims, Jews and others in prayerful communion this week, isn't he?

I enjoy watching AI..(go David Cook) I could not believe they were singing some spiritual song. I was
shocked. Where did that come from? Who OK'd that one??? After all all, AI is on FOX! I donatedbefore they sang the song. It would of turned me off had they sang the song before I gave.

weren't in a high school choir. The bulk of what choirs sing, especially for concerts around the holidays
is Christian music. A great deal of great harmony to practice was written for the church. And yes, eventoday high school choirs practice these same songs. If you are a Catholic and that song offends you I
am quite surprised. 
The point is Contemporary Christian Music has carved itself out as a big portion of music industry
revenues. Have you even seen the vast array of contemporary Christian music the recording industry isputting out? This is after all a singing contest. This is, after all, an attempt to identify a singer who can
sell records. Leaving this genre out of the game is like leaving out Country or leaving out Pop. 
"Shout to the Lord" is a popular Christian worship song and has been quite popular for 15 years. It has
been recorded several times and is featured on albums that have gone platinum.
Try to remember folks, this is a singing contest. It amazes me that singing this song has caused
controversy, while if someone sang "Sympathy for the Devil" which is a great rock and roll song by the
Rolling Stones, no one would have batted an eye.

You attended a very unusual public high school if you had a choir in the first place. Music,theater, art -- all out the window at most public schools in the country, sad to say. And if you
attended a public school and they had a choir AND "the bulk" of what they sang is Christian
music...well, I don't know where you went to school but in the current political climate thatstrikes me as bizarre to say the least. I'm surprised parents haven't complained and the ACLUfiled a lawsuit. That is NOT standard practice -- whether someone thinks that's terrible orwonderful, it just isn't. I sang in the choir on Sundays when I was little at my Catholic church,but my Catholic school did not have a choir as such, no. And obviously you didn't attend BobJones University, where they ban CCM from the dorm rooms.
As my post, said (did you read it?), I explcitly said Shout To The Lord was not offensive to
me as a Caholic lyrically though there are MANY evangelical songs that emphasize ideas orbeliefs not compatible with my faith (which ain't the same as being "offensive," just tunes Iwouldn't sing). Indeed, there are whole branches of CCM that liberal evangelicals reject andvice-versa. CCM is a vibrant genre, though like every other genre it is struggling in the post-record store world. But since you can buy Larry Norman and Keith Green on iTunes, it willsurvive.

So sorry for you, but yes we did and yes they still do, and no lawsuits are filed. Youmight be surprised at the number of public schools who still rely on this music toteach 4 part harmony. I was simply pointing out that this is a singing contest, so let'snot get our panties in a twist. I didn't like 50s or 60s week either. Big deal. 
Regarding whether you were offended. If you weren't, I guess in point #3 "I am a
Catholic and I am offended." was a "mis-statement"? Obviously, I read it.
Christian music is a part of the market share. I used to work for a label as creative
director. I understand the market.
WebDeb See Profile  I'm a Fan of WebDeb  permalink
Thanks for your reply, but I stand by what I say. This "surprising" fact that Christianmusic is sung in public high schools is true. And, that same school I attended, thatmy grandchildren attend, still uses those songs to entertain parents at concerts inthe high school drum. Don't shoot the messenger. It's a fact. I just think people makesuch a big deal out of everything that they don't personally agree with.
And yes, Michael I read your post. And, I was commenting on the fact that you
mentioned in your bullet point #3. "I'm a Catholic, and I was offended". Sooooooo
maybe you didn't proofread before you posted?
I was the creative director for a Christian music label. I know about market share.

Please don't use the condescending Bushie phrase of "folks" when referring to people who
happened to think it was BS to have this religious song on the show, just as it washorrendous to have to listen to the hysterical Jesus song sung by Dolly Parton a week or soearlier, and - worst of all - Cookie Girl (who looks just like Bush) singing "God Bless the USA"in a most calculating way. This show is obviously becoming a mouthpiece for the right wing,and I'm sick of them using the contestants - and the viewers - in such a way.
WebDeb See Profile  I'm a Fan of WebDeb  permalink
If you think the phrase "folks" is right wing, then broaden your horizons. It's rural,and I'm over 50 and I'm allowed to say any damn thing I want, until the Bush whitehouse takes away that constitutional right too. 
And, don't tell me I'm condescending..... are you working for the Hillary camp, by
taking a "word" that means nothing and turning it into an issue? If you aren't maybeyou should apply for the job.
And, you don't have to be a republican to have an opinion that doesn't agree with
yours. And, republicans don't have the market cornered on faith either. It is a right
we all have, to worship as we choose, and to embrace what we choose. UnlessMcBush gets in the White House, then you can probably kiss that goodbye too.
So some people wanted to hear this stuff. So what? I listen to Country and don't like
that. Do I go to a website and declare war on Texans? Give it a rest.

Thats right, because Mick and the Stones never shoved their opinion down your throat of howyou should live your life , just like the evangels, fake christians...
Jesus would be turning over in his grave if he saw what you people call a good christian, 
Evangelicals are two faced, double standard, delusional people with very small minds..
Oh, and Christian music will NEVER be a "big portion of music industry revenues" as you
say. It has its little niche of the market but dont you DARE try comparing christian music to
"real, solid, well written music, written from the true self within and not conjured up by a falsegod.

chooses to sing such tunes. I didn't condemn the song -- I condemned telling all eight
contestants of varying faiths (or no faith at all) to sing an evangelical Christian song. That's it.As some evangelical Christians pointed out in the comments, Shout to the Lord is intended to
proselytize and shouldn't be sung without sincerity and a desire to spread the word of Jesus.
Doing so would cheapen the song and its message. Just one more reason why having it as a
group sing-along was inappropriate.

Listening to a hymn with four part harmony can be very awe inspiring indeed especially when you are
standing right in the middle of it and it surrounds you from all sides. I would have picked "Fairest Lord
Jesus" for the group song; that"s the one that goes " Beautiful savior! Lord of the nations! Son of God
and Son of man!" and so on and so forth ..You know the one? If you are Catholic or Lutheran you
have to know that one! 
The other song that could have been done is of course "Amazing Grace". Here was a missed
opportunity to sing a hymn with some great four part harmony and "Amazing Grace" has such a longstoried history behind it that it almost transcends controversy about religion. Napster has 493 differentrecordings of Amazing Grace by artists ranging from Aretha Franklin to Phish, and from the Oak RidgeBoys to the Vienna Choir Boys to Jeff Beck; but I could find only one recording of "My Jesus, MySavior". 
There are some really beautiful hymns worth listening to and if you really do love music you will
appreciate the sound. Music is not about the words. Words without music is just poetry and American
Idol is not a poetry contest.

It never fails.Someone can't rest untill religion is inserted.This gives assurance that we can have
controversy.If Jesus were here today he would most likely be vomiting as He watches all the bullshit
going on in this day and time.

What's all this buzz about "God" and "Jesus"? They're just make-believe characters, sort of like Barney
the Purple dinosaur-like character. 
But I can see where some are offended. No reasonable person likes having make-believe characters
talked about as if they were really real, and then having laws passed and wars started because peoplebelieve they really ARE real.

This blog has attracted a number of defeatist comments in which feigned apathy is combined withunfocused anger to create a virtual pity party. Self pity has replaced football as America's #1 pass timesfor many who've commented on this blog. Oh the pain-the furslinger pain, get me my veeble-fetzer[stolen from MAD & 57 years of reading MAD]. Damn, I'm writing word salad. It is time to go back toreading my book on the Korean war.larry lynch

Feigned apathy, unfocused anger and self-pity are the custom here. We don't take kindly to

I agree that it is not right to ask someone to sing something that is not of their conscience, especially in
a competition where that may sway the results.
As an "evangelical" I do not mind hearing people sing something that is their faith in a setting like this,
but I was offended or rather just awkward to observe this because I am pretty sure not all the singersshare the same faith. BTW--Dolly was cool, even though her genre is not my fave.
Just to note, they did NOT get permission to change and indeed did fumble.

Can you imagine them singing about Mohammed or Buddha? The fundies would just die! So to claim it
was "just" a song is incorrect. Who is behind these asinine choices that Idol is making? This was a
major screw up.

To all those Jesus lovers, if he were to come back to this planet they would cruxify him again because
what they have become, is so far away from his initial Philosophy.After all, he was a practicing Jew!

Nah...they'd just stick him in a "free speech zone" half a mile from the flow of traffic...and we'dall be too busy talking about American Idol to notice.
"Problem" solved & everybody can go to bed with a clean conscience.
