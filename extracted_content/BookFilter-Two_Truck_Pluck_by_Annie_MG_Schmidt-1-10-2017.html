What We Say
The Dutch writer Annie M.G. Schmidt had a long and illustrious career I've been mostly ignorant of till now. Her work is
being translated into English with new fervor by David Colmer. While another recent title ("The Cat Who Came In Off TheRoof") didn't win me over, the low-key charm of this story was a treat from start to finish. The droll illustrations of
Schmidt's long-time collaborator Fiep Westendorp are a welcome and essential element in that charm. The story is dead
simple: a little boy named Pluck has a red tow-truck and toodles about the city. He discovers an empty room at the top ofan apartment building and moves in, making friends with most everyone from the store owners nearby to many of hisShare This Book

<p>neighbors and above all the animals -- the cockroach he adopts as a pet, the pigeon named Dolly, the seagull named Carl
and many many others. Pluck has mini-adventures in every chapter, from befriending the little girl whose mother insists she
never ever go out and play because she might get dirty to rescuing a bird fated to be killed, stuffed and displayed in a bird
museum. Each adventure leads casually to the next and the challenges facing Pluck become satisfyingly more complicatedas the book goes on. More and more of his friends come back and help out in later tales and before you know it, Pluck issurrounded by a warm and supportive community. Disarming and sweet, the book also has a genuinely complex worldview,with a strong pro-environmental and anti-authoritarian attitude balanced rather surprisingly by a practical realization that
we can't all goof off and play or who would put out fires or bake the bread people need? (Mind you, a little play is a good
idea -- especially for adults.) Sly and smart and not so easy to pigeonhole. Now I want to read the stories of "Jip andJanneke!" -- Michael Giltz
