DISGRACED
LCT3 AT CLAIRE TOW THEATER
Disgraced  hopes to be a provocative drama, the sort of
entertainment that pushes a few buttons while
portraying characters who have a veneer of civility butunderneath embody the darkest urges of us all. Think
Neil LaBute or Yasmina Reza.
While those two can excel at high concept but
sometimes stumble on believable characters, playwrightAyad Akhtar has a promising talent for real charactersbut their disagreements are too polite and the hoped-for
shock when ugly prejudice is bared simply leaves us wondering if these are the same characters we'vebeen watching for the past hour.
Aasif Mandvi of The Daily Show  is solid as Amir Kapoor, an American lawyer of Pakistani origin who has
allowed his bosses to believe he's Indian. One gives him a Hindu statue for a gift even though he was
raised Muslim and is a strident non-believer. He lives on the Upper East Side with his beautiful wifeEmily (a fine Heidi Armbruster) and the possibility of a partnership down the road.
Amir's nephew (an appealing Omar Maskati) wears a baseball cap and now goes by the name of "Abe"
but the teenager's assimilation hasn't kept him from finding strength in Islam. He begs his uncle torepresent a religious leader who has been accused (wrongly, the boy believes) of links to terrorism. Amirwants nothing to do with it; he paid a visit to the imam who spent their entire time together trying to getAmir to pray. But his nephew keeps insisting and Emily (a painter who has found intense inspiration inPersian art) adds her voice.
Reluctantly, unhappily, he becomes more involved. But not before the show's most convincing and
memorable moment. Amir pins down his nephew into admitting that many of the adults in their circledisdain Western women and consider them whores for the way they dress. He tells Emily that his mother
feels the same ("I thought she liked me," Emily murmurs) and then delivers the knock-out blow: a tale of
childhood romance in which Amir had a crush on a Jewish girl in his class. When his mother discoversthis, she angrily insists he never speak to the girl again; if he does, she'll break his bones. And so he'dMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>never forget, his mother spat in Amir's face. At school the next day, he spat in the girl's face himself.
That's the ugliness that Amir rejects, the narrow-mindedness he faced and wants no part of from his
culture.
Amir doesn't mock his nephew for practicing. In fact, he gently mocks the kid for adopting such a
Western name as "Abe" and refuses to use it. But he's a corporate lawyer and loves America and if Islam
has no appeal to him, he has personal and intellectual reasons that resonate strongly and convincingly.
Yet he is  a lawyer and injustice is wrong, even for a religious leader he has no patience for. Amir is
dragged back into the case.
That sets off a chain of events that include a quote from Amir in The New York Times  where it might
seem to readers that he and his law firm are representing the accused terrorist and ultimately a dinner
party where Emily is going to discover if her Persian-inspired artwork will be accepted for a big show.
To this point, Disgraced  has been a rather placid evening with modest disagreements expressed in the
most polite of manners. It's when the playwright tries to push our buttons too readily that the show goes
off the rails. It's easy to disguise a person's prejudice with social niceties and then reveal with coded
words and increasingly brutal language the prejudice that simmers underneath.
Disgraced  doesn't do that. Instead, our main character is set up quite believably as one sort of man
shaped by his family and intellectual growth (not to mention the Western culture he lives in and fully
embraces) only to have him do a 180 and prove to be the exact opposite of what he's been shown to be.Amir rejects his family's faith because of its anti-Semitism and backwardness towards women. Thensuddenly we're told in fact he gets a warm feeling when world leaders discuss wiping Israel off the face ofthe earth and 9/11 was wrong (of course they brought up 9/11) but yeah, he felt a little pride that Muslims
were fighting back. And if his wife cheats on him, why he's just a moment away from the Quran's
imperative to beat her silly.
Similarly, the liberal-minded Jewish art dealer (Erik Jensen) is soon insisting that he knows why
Muslims are called animals. The nephew reverts from an assimilated kid to an ascetic who dons
traditional garb and hangs out with guys in Starbucks who tell people the West got what it deserved. And
most confusingly and pointlessly of all, Emily's artistic breakthrough by drawing upon Persian imagery isrejected by Emily herself as naive. Huh?
This all explodes thanks to plot twists that pile onto each other in an especially awkward manner, each
one less convincing than the last, or rather, less interesting. There's nothing unconvincing about maritalinfidelity or having a co-worker leap you on the corporate ladder. But none of it has any bearing on theweighty religious and cultural topics that Disgraced  clumsily raises. It certainly isn't the fault of the cast,
which is fine throughout, with Karen Pittman especially good as that co-worker of Amir's, probablybecause she's the most internally consistent character on the stage and isn't asked to suddenly turn into
someone entirely different. Pittman also has an appealing warmth and intelligence.
It's only 90 minutes but Disgraced  felt much longer. Perhaps when Akhtar listens to the vivid characters
he can create rather than jumping them through hoops he'll deliver a longer play that feels shorter.
