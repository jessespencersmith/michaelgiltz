I don't care if the ratings are momentarily down a tick -- American Idol  is still the number one
show on TV and I still watch it avidly. This season seemed to mark the beginning of a kinder,
gentler Idol  with the scenes of judges and bad singers emphasizing their kid glove treatment. And
of course the major switch was a renewed emphasis on the backstory of the kids auditioning, whichmeant lots of single parents, ill relatives, cute kids and most heart-tugging of all, cute kids withserious illnesses. This "Queen For A Day" approach has always been there. But forgive me forhoping the biggest sob stories don't get out of Hollywood -- I hate to think of people getting votesfor their personal tragedies and triumphs rather than for their singing. Tuesday's notables:
Tetiana Ostapouych  -- She walked in looking smug and self-satisfied. Ooh, I thought, our first
villain if she can actually sing. And she can, warbling "Someone To Watch Over Me" in a manner
that begged for the dreaded "cabaret" or "Broadway" slam from Simon. Tetiana was surprised butaggressive when Simon criticized her and she was ready to make any changes, but said so in a waythat made you feel she didn't think she really HAD to make any changes. With a nose thatStreisand would be proud of (that's not a slam; it's the one thing that keeps her looks from dullbeauty), she has the aggressive air of someone that can't let you appreciate them for whateverappeal they have because she already appreciates it before you. Simon, as usual, nailed it when hesaid "Obnoxious!" after she left. But fame-hungry artists often ARE obnoxious. It's part of the drivethat keeps them going. So keep your eye on Tetiana as one you might love to hate but which can'tbe denied if her singing is more versatile than it appears.
Perrie Cataldo  -- a single dad who sang Boyz II
Men. Our first heart-tugging entry. I remember his
kid better than I remember his better-than-average
singing.
Michael Johns  -- a married Australian, Johns gave
a Michael Bolton approach to Otis Redding's "I've Been Loving You Too Long." (By the way, I love
it when people auditioning introduce their song as if it's a hidden gem. "I'm going to sing an Otis

<p>Michael Giltz: American Idol Auditions: Week Two
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/american-idol-au_b_82878.html [4/5/2009 8:07:28 PM]Redding song called "I've; Been Loving...." No, you're gonna sing the world-famous Otis Redding
classic, please.) Good but he may be a little affected. Plus, he's married which cancels out his solid
good looks.
Valerie Reyes  -- if the first week of Idol  went astray in any way, it was including too many
people on camera who were just grandstanding to get on TV. Clueless singers are fine. But people
in silly get-ups or people pretending to be angry and going on an unconvincing tirade just because
the cameras are rolling are a waste of time. A quick montage is plenty entertaining for the real
losers. Reyes was genuinely clueless about her singing skills but she brought out the mean streak in
Idol . Last season or so, Ryan Seacrest had developed a nasty habit of toying with kids he was
intervieiwing by letting awkward pauses develop so that the kids would look stupid or blurt
something out. He seems to do the same with Reyes. Perhaps he isn't given any backstory, but I
assume he's clued in as to who is good, who has a sob story he might highlight and who is a
dreadful singer. That certainly seemed the case with Reyes since Ryan interviewed her specificallyabout clueless singers and how they laugh at them at home. Then Reyes walked into the auditionroom and destroyed "Against All Odds." Cheap shot.
Monique Gibson  -- here, they got the balance of how to treat a bad singer correctly. Monique
was dreadful, but the she seemed to take the judges' reactions in a good-natured way. They were
friendly but blunt and it all seemed a relatively OK wake-up call until suddenly tears startedstreaming down her face. Randy and Paula and Simon all immediately comforted her and showedempathy and seemed taken aback since Monique had seemed stable. The show caught the pathosof her not realizing how little talent she had without making fun of her.
Samantha Musa  -- this was the singer whose sister peched on Simon's lap. She sang Aretha and
had a rough high note but was pretty good.Blake Boshnack -- here Idol  wrongly celebrates obsessive determination. This guy has
auditioned in about ten cities, including the time he dressed up as the Statue of Liberty (a moment
Simon rightly ended after about two notes). He sang "Stand By Me" and while Blake probably killed
at his own bar mitzvah it was just absurd and sad for him (and his mom) to think he has a talent
for anything more than karaoke. This was followed immediately by one of the new  Idol  songs --
sung by Rod Stewart over footage of Blake -- presumably meant for the montage scene when asinger is sent home. It included lines about how you should "never give up on your dream."
Actually, that sentiment -- and the celebration of Blake's misguided, repeated auditions -- should
be the OPPOSITE of the what  Idol  is about. In fact, you SHOULDN'T pursue your dream if your
dream is playing in the NBA and you're 5 feet 7 inches tall and can't sink a basketball. The constant
message of the show (in ways both mean and kind) is that it's not ENOUGH to want to be a "star."You have to have talent. But that's not enough either. You also have to work really, really hard. Andthat's not usually enough either. You also need a little luck. If the judges say you suck and willnever, ever be a professinal singer, that doesn't mean you should "persevere." It means you shouldfind a new dream and hopefully rethink the allure of fame. Talk about mixed messages.
David Archuleta  -- a sweet-looking 16 year old kid who has the heartwarming backstory of
fighting vocal paralysis. That's nice. His audition -- John Mayer's "Waiting On The World To
Change" -- was pretty good, even though he forgot some of the words. (Oddly, I don't think thejudges mentioned this. Even more oddly, Simon praised this as a great choice of song even thoughit's been done on Idol  before so hardly counts as groundbreaking.) He was also nervous,
tentative, and failed to make eye contact very much. Decent voice but needs a few years ofseasoning and maturity. But he's somewhat Tiger beat-ish and the judges rushed him through,which seemed to have as much to do with his backstory as his performance.
Carly Smithson  -- an Irish lass who auditioned in a previous season and made it to Hollywood
but her visa expired before she could go. That's a pretty devastating backstory, though what the
Idol  producers failed to disclose was that Carly later signed a major label record deal and had
millions spent on her debut CD before it all fell apart. That doesn't have quite the same tragic airabout it, does it? I don't mind backup singers and people who've been on the brink auditioning(even though it doesn't feel quite in the spirit of the show). But I MUCH prefer full disclosure. Ifyour band had a record deal and released a single on a major label, if you won Star Search  when
you were younger, if you had a hit single in Japan, I want to know. In fact, I need to know and Ifeel cheated if I discover this later. Full disclosure,  Idol producers. Carly is going to Hollywood.
Good, she has a fine voice. But she certainly knows the way there, in every sense and we shouldknow that in advance.
