Your guide to the newest and best theater books of 2020.How to put this? The year 2020 was…not the best for theater lovers. Performances wereshut down and live theatre was unavailable. Zoom readings and the like are fun and we’vewatched them all. But they are unfortunately not live theater and what’s a holiday withouta live performance? There won’t be pantomimes in London nor A Christmas Carol at thelocal high school this year.Maybe you can’t give your friends (or yourself) tickets to that touring production or thatnew Broadway hit for a performance anytime soon. But that stocking won’t be bare if youtake our advice. When the stages are dark, turn to books about theater and bring it allback to life. We’ve got co!ee table books, memoirs, hit "ction, picture books for kids, titlesperfect for the would-be Broadway baby, mysteries set in the world of theater, and more!Whether it’s a way to keep yourself sane or a treat for a friend or loved one missing theirdramatic "x, we’ve got a roundup of the latest and best theater books for 2020.  
Singular Sensation: The Triumph Of Broadway By Michael Riedel $28, Avid Reader Press/Simon & Schuster Sondheim: Lyrics By Stephen Sondheim; Introduction by Peter Gethers $14.95, Everyman’s Library The Oxford Book Of Theatrical Anecdotes By Gyles Brandreth $27.95, Oxford University Press Journalist Michael Riedel’s Singular Sensation is the theater book of the season. His earlierbook Razzle Dazzle was a well-researched history of the 1970s and 1980s as seen throughthe story of the Shuberts. But now he covers the 1990s, and since Riedel was actually therecovering the theater world, his writing has an immediacy and detail not seen before. It’sjuicy, opinionated fun. A pocket-sized book of Sondheim lyrics is always the perfectstocking stu!er, and a collection of backstage gossip, onstage triumphs and tragedies, andthe like from Oxford lets you pretend it’s edifying rather than a dishy delight. 
Hamnet By Maggie O’Farrell $26.95, Knopf Actress By Anne Enright $26.95, W.W. Norton & Company Shadowplay By Joseph O’Connor $26, Europa Editions Sweet Sorrow By David Nicholls $27, Houghton Mi#in Harcourt Four acclaimed, very successful novels. Maggie O’Farrell enjoyed the literary breakout ofthe year with Hamnet, her reimagining of Shakespeare, his bewitching wife, and the childwho died from the plague…and thus inspired Shakespeare’s masterpiece of gloom. InActress, Anne Enright turns us to a mother-daughter relationship with the story of a youngwoman in the shadow of her mother – an Irish theater legend. She might become hermother’s caregiver but that won’t stop her from uncovering secrets the grand dame wouldrather stay buried. With Shadowplay, Joseph O’Connor gives us a vivid, exciting backstoryfor how Bram Stoker’s “Dracula” came to be – don’t be scared, it’s tangled up with Stoker’searly experience working in theater. And the best-selling David Nicholls scores again withSweet Sorrow, a heart-tugger about a man remembering a summer in England when hewas just 16 years old and joined a company to act in Romeo & Juliet just so he could pursuethe girl of his dreams. 
Time To Act: An Intimate Photographic Portrait Of Actors Backstage  By Simon Annand, Foreword by Cate Blanchett $50, Lannoo PublishersWest Side Story: The Jets, The Sharks and the Making Of A Classic By Richard Barrios $28, Running Press Hamilton: Portraits Of The Revolution By Josh Lehrer, Preface by Thomas Kail, Foreword by Lin-Manuel Miranda $35, Universe Co!ee table time! Have you ever wondered what it’s like backstage before, during, andafter a performance? Photographer Simon Annand captures that rarely seen world in hisnew book that’s both beautiful and revealing. Turner Classic Movies puts its stamp on aseries of books about classic Hollywood and this new release covers the making of themovie musical classic West Side Story. Sure, it was supposed to hit shelves while a newrevival played on Broadway and we looked forward to Steven Spielberg’s new "lm versionat Christmas. We’ll have to wait for both of those a while longer, but the book is here now,bursting with photographs and inside dirt on how the quirkier-than-you-remember moviecame to be. And portraits of the insanely talented people behind the Broadway landmarkHamilton because… it’s Hamilton. It’s only the second o$cial book spun o! from the showand since you’ve watched the concert "lm a thousand times, this is another way to cherishit again. 
Tallulah Plays The Tuba By Ti!any Stone, Illustrations by Sandy Nichols $18.95, Annick Press William Shakespeare’s The Tempest By Georghia Ellinas; Illustrations by Jane Ray $17.99, Candlewick Nonsense! The Curious Story Of Edward Gorey By Lori Mortensen; Illustrations by Chloe Bristol $17.99; Versify It’s never too soon to introduce kids to the idea of the performing arts and these threepicture books are a great way to start. Tallulah Plays The Tuba is a sweet tale of a little girlwho wants to play a big tuba and uses her brains and the help of friends to make ithappen. The Globe in London may be on hiatus but you can support their marvelous workby savoring The Tempest, a beautifully illustrated spin on the classic play. And kids with anysort of imaginative spark will appreciate Edward Gorey, the man who created brilliant setsfor Broadway shows when not sharing his ghoulish humor via books and comic panels forThe New Yorker. This bio-picture book captures his wicked world with panache and just likethe other two books, it’s ideal for kids of all ages. 
I Want To Be Where The Normal People Are By Rachel Bloom $28, Grand Central Publishing This Is Not My Memoir By Andre Gregory and Todd London $27, Farrar, Straus, and Giroux Me By Elton John $19.99, Gri$n Dancing Man: A Broadway Choreographer’s Journey By Bob Avian with Tom Santopietro $28, University Press Of Mississippi Mozart: The Reign Of Love By Jan Swa!ord $45, Harper Triple-threat Rachel Bloom has popped into the Tony Awards but has not yet been a staron Broadway. Surely that will change soon for the creator and star of the musical comedyseries Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. Until then, enjoy her honest and funny memoir about Bloom’smessy, ful"lling life. While Bloom looks forward to Broadway, director and talent AndreGregory looks back on a life in the avant-garde world of theater with the wit, charm, andstorytelling ability you expect from a star of the classic "lm My Dinner With Andre. Quick!Who has major credits on three of the 75 most successful musicals of all time? That’s right:Elton John with Billy Elliot, Aida, and The Lion King. So his soul-baring memoir Me is a must-read for theater fans. Yes, Taron Eggerton of Rocketman appears on the audiobook, andno, he won’t deliver a copy of the book to you in person. We tried. Director-choreographerBob Avian has done it all, from his work on A Chorus Line to Dreamgirls to teachingKatharine Hepburn how to sing and dance. He tells his story in Dancing Man, but in atypically self-e!acing style, it is his celebration of the talent he worked with you’llremember best. Those who dive into classical music and opera will want to dive intoMozart, a major new biography of the genius that spends as much time analyzing hisimmense body of work as retelling his life. And really, isn’t the work what matters?
Murder At The Playhouse By Helena Dixon $10.99, Bookouture The Great Hotel Murder By Vincent Starrett, Introduction by Lyndsay Faye $15.95, American Mystery Classics Shakespeare For Squirrels By Christopher Moore $28.99, William Morrow If you love theater and mysteries, we’re sure you’re as bummed as we are that the re-opening of Agatha Christie’s The Mousetrap in the West End had to be delayed. Until then,enjoy these three delicious tales of a crime set in the world of the theater. In Murder At ThePlayhouse, Kitty Underhay is sparring with her rather dashing ex-captain, ex-boyfriendMatthew Bryant. But that won’t stop the amateur sleuth from jumping into action whenhe’s (wrongly!) accused of murder in this 1933-set romp. The Chicago theater scene gets itsdue in a reissue of The Great Hotel Murder, in which theater critic and amateur sleuth RileyBlackwood must sort through a pile of bodies and missing suspects to solve a puzzle. Thenovel was turned into a "lm in 1935 but has been wrongly forgotten since then. And forsheer nuttiness, you can’t beat the comic insanity of Christopher Moore’s Shakespeare ForSquirrels. The hero Pocket and his sidekick Drool (not to mention a pet monkey Je!) stormtheir way through a retelling of A Midsummer Night’s Dream by way of Dashiell Hammett. Ifthat sounds at all appealing, don’t hesitate. 
Cast Of Mentors: Volume 1 By Ken Davenport $35, Producer’s Perspective This Is Shakespeare By Emma Smith $28.95, PantheonAll The Sonnets Of Shakespeare Edited by Paul Edmondson and Stanley Wells $17.95, Cambridge University Press The Kilroys List Vol. 2: 67 Monologues and Scenes By Women and Nonbinary Playwrights Edited by Anna Feinberg and Gina Young, Foreword by Lynn Nottage $16.95, Theatre Communications Group Four books for those who want to tackle a career in the theater. Tony-winning Broadwayproducer Ken Davenport o!ers up the most inspiring stories and nuggets of wisdom fromartists like Kathleen Marshall, Terrence McNally, Dominique Morisseau, and dozens morewho joined him on his podcast called The Producer’s Perspective. Davenport calls them hismentors because their insights have inspired him so much and now he believes they’llinspire anyone pursuing their dream. Emma Smith’s This Is Shakespeare positively revels inthe contradictions and confusions that arise when you really dive into the work of theBard. Consider her book the master class you never had in all things William S. And really,if you’re going to take theater or poetry or life and love seriously, shouldn’t you soak upShakespeare’s sonnets at some point? All the Sonnets collect them all in chronologicalorder, including the ones embedded in plays, and o!er up some pithy insights viafootnotes and the like. Finally, the rise of so many diverse playwrights means actorslooking for something new to perform have many riches to choose from. In The Kilroys List,the 67(!) monologues and scenes on tap here are created by women and nonbinaryplaywrights. 
Black Bottom Saints By Alice Randall $26.99, Amistad We Came Here To Shine By Susie Orman Schnall $16.99, Gri$n Here We Are By Graham Swift $22.95, Knopf Finally, a love of performing can begin (or end) anywhere. In Alice Randall’s acclaimednovel Black Bottom Saints, a Detroit neighborhood as rich in talent as Harlem springs to lifevia the death-bed memories of a nightclub emcee. Joseph “Ziggy” Johnson rubbed elbowswith everyone from Dinah Washington to Count Basie when not founding his own ZiggyJohnson School Of Theatre. Think Ragtime crossed with The Cotton Club. And if you’ve gotthe acting bug, you’ll perform anywhere. In We Came Here To Shine, that’s how an actresswith her eye on Hollywood "nds herself at the 1939 World’s Fair in New York City starringin one of those ridiculous water spectacles of synchronized swimming. Hey, you neverknow who might be in the audience! And English novelist Graham Swift (Waterland, LastOrders) enjoyed some of the best reviews of his career with the gem Here We Are. It revelsin the invariably seedy setting of vaudeville, in this case, the fading world of BrightonBeach seaside performers. Three friends – one in a variety act, another a comic, and thethird in a magic act – come together, fall apart, and wonder where it all went wrong.
