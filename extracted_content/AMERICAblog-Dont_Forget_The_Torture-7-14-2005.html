7/14/2005 06:30:00 PMMeanwhile, while White House officials are leaking state secretsin a time of war, torture is being committed in our name.Torture -- the evil tool of Castro and Stalin and dictatorsaround the world. Torture -- the cruel, inhuman practice of thebad guys that heros like our World War II and Vietnamprisoners of war endured stoically but all decent peoplecondemned. Torture -- thanks to Bush -- is now the Americanway.Actually, it makes sense: the same people who defendtorture are the same people defending Karl Rove, a manwho endangered national security in a dirty tricks campaign.The Washington Post details the obvious -- that the samemethods used in Abu Ghraib denounced by Bush and everyonearound the world began in Guantanamo Bay.The Post also has an online discussion from Bush Sr's personalphysician -- he denounced the use of medical personnel inoverseeing that torture in an op-ed column.And if you haven't picked up the current double issue of TheNew Yorker, Jane Mayer has a devastating feature on thetorture at Guantanamo Bay and the unprecedented andfrightening use of doctors. Not that we want to mention theNazis, but of course it was the horrifying practices of the ThirdReich's doctors that shocked the world and led to newstandards being set by the international medical community --standards our doctors are now breaking in Guantanamo Bay.It's a great article for rebutting the people who want to pretendthe only claims about torture come from prisoners told to lie ina training manual. Mayer speaks to FBI agents, US militarylawyers, former interrogators, soldiers and references thereports filed by the military itself. The article isn't online, butMayer's q and a about it is available here.
