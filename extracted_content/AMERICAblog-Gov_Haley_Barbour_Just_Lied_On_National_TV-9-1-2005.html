9/01/2005 11:02:00 AMOn CNN, Miles O'Brien questioned Gov. Haley Barbour aboutpreparations for this devastating hurricane. And Haley Barbourflat out LIED on national tv. He said that we only had "a fewhours" of warning before realizing Hurricane Katrina was goingto be a category 4 or 5 storm. When it hit Florida, Barboursaid, it was only a category 1. O'Brien tried to interrupt himand call Barbour on this outrageous lie (does Barbour think wehaven't been watching TV for the past five days?) but Barbourshouted him down and acted as if inconvenient facts weren'tgoing to stop him from wriggling his way out of responsibility.The FACTS are that Hurrican Katrina made landfall in Florida onThursday night. Here's a CNN report from Friday evening at 10p.m. making perfectly clear that more than two days beforestriking the Gulf Coast, everyone knew this was threatening tobe a tremendous disaster.Gov. Barbour just lied on national TV about THE MOST BASICFACTS of this disaster and he should be blasted by every localand national media outlet until he apologizes and admits eithergross incompetence (and steps down) or that he flat out lied.
