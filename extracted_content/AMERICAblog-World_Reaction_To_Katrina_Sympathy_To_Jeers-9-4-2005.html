9/04/2005 10:20:00 PMAn amazing range of responses are coming from around theworld. The LA Times saw everything from concern to jeers --and you know your country's image around the world must beat ROCK BOTTOM when a horrific disaster like this results injeers. But USA Today's was the most eye-opening (andamusing, frankly). Canada's prime minister was rightly pilloriedfor saying nothing till late Wednesday. Some Islamic extremistssaid Katrina was part of their global jihad (they must becribbing from Pat Robertson) and Venezuela's Chavez dubbedBush "king of vacations."
