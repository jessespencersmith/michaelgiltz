 Next Year's Oscars Will Have Ten
Best Picture Nominees
Read More:  Academy Awards , Movies, Oscars, The Dark
Knight , Entertainment News
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences
and ABC announced today that the Oscars will
expand its Best Picture list to 10 films for next
year's ceremony. They're pitching it as a return totradition but in fact the last time 10 films were
nominated for Best Picture was in 1943 when
Casablanca  won the top prize. (Hmm, since that
one triumphed, maybe it's not such a bad idea.)
Obviously, they're still smarting from last year's
ceremony when critically acclaimed and  wildly
popular movies like The Dark Knight  and WALL-
E weren't in the running. But what do you think? Is this going to cheapen the prestige of being
nominated for Best Picture? Or will it broaden the appeal of the Oscars and let the list of nomineesactually reflect the range of good movies shown throughout the year?
To refresh your memory, the five nominees for Best Picture from 2008 were:The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button
Frost/NixonMilkThe Reader
Slumdog Millionare
With of course, Slumdog  becoming top dog. Now based strictly on total number of nominations in
every category, if the top nominees became the top picks for Best Picture, the list last year might
have been:
The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button
ChangelingThe Dark Knight
Pals: Mischa Barton Struggled
with Body Issues

Is that a more exciting list? Of course, nominations don't mean you will automatically make it on
the list for Best Picture. Other acclaimed films that might have made it onto the Best Picture list
include:
Happy-Go-Lucky
Iron Man
Waltz With Bashir
The Wrestler
If the list means popular and  acclaimed films like  WALL-E and The Dark Knight  are in the mix,
it'll be a success. If it just means more art house films like Doubt  and  Revolutionary Road,  the list
will rightly be seen as more of the same. Next year, if UP  is not  nominated for Best Picture, there
will rightly be an outcry. Almost as loud an outcry if something commercially successful but
godawful like Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen does  make it.
So what do you think about this radical change by the Oscars?

A 10-movie field sure came in handy in 1939. These were the nominees:
Dark Victory 
Gone With the Wind 
Goodbye, Mr. Chips
Love Affair 
Mr. Smith Goes to Washington 
Ninotchka 
Of Mice and Men 
Stagecoach 
The Wizard of Oz
Wuthering Heights
Of course, not every year is 1939. there were a few years in the '80s when it was tough to scrape up 5
worthy nominees.

I think it's a great idea, and I like your list. I'd switch out Revolutionary Road for The Wrestler
though. I love the actors and the director, but RR was not better than The Wrestler. I keptthinking, just move back to New York, you morons.
My own, laughably unrealistic, list:
The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button
ChangelingThe Dark KnightThe FallFrozen RiverIn BrugeMilkSlumdog MillionaireTropic Thunder (I know I know, I *said* it was unrealistic)WALL-EThe Wrestler
I know that list has some iffy titles. Tropic Thunder is not "better" than Doubt, which is a very good
movie and deserved its nomination. It's just that I enjoyed TT more. I'm glad Robert Downey Jr. gotnominated and I wasn't upset that the movie itself didn't get nominated. The Fall is not a great movie,but it did have the best performance by an actress, and was the most visually stunning movie of thepast several years. 
In other threads, people are saying there weren't enough good movies. That's crazy talk. I saw 170
movies in the theater last year and STILL missed some excellent movies I wish I had seen (like Snow

Angels, Encounters at the End Of the World, and Trouble the Water, just to name a few). Fully 3/4 of
the films I saw were worthwhile and at least half were excellent.
