8/16/2005 05:45:00 PMUSA Today says it's concerned about Supreme Court nomineeJohn Roberts. It also says a right to privacy -- the right to beleft alone, as Justice Brandeis put it -- is a fundamentalAmerican right deeply rooted in our nation's history and adeal-breaker. The Supreme Court already has three Justiceswho don't believe in a right to privacy and it doesn't need afourth. USA Today says Roberts MUST be asked about a right toprivacy and if he's unwilling to uphold 200+ years of legalprecendent and a bedrock American principal like the right tobe left alone, then he MUST be rejected.A vast majority of Americans support "the right to be leftalone," from hippie liberals to far right conservatives. MostAmericans would be deeply troubled by a Supreme Court judgewho doesn't agree with such a simple proposition. It's awinning position, a popular position and the right position.Imagine Republican Senators who support Roberts having todefend in 2006 why they don't believe Americans have theright to be left alone. Too bad the Dems can't see this.
