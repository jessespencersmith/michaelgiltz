9/05/2005 01:47:00 PMI watched Bill Maher on Friday and all the Sunday morningnews shows and the Monday morning's Today and GMA. I didn'thear one word, one word about the most simple, basic fact ofthis story.George Bush stayed on vacation. He didn't get back to work.When the worst natural disaster in our nation's history attackedus, George Bush STAYED ON VACATION. Why did the federalgovernment stumble so badly on Monday and Tuesday andWednesday? Because on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday,George Bush stayed on vacation in Crawford, Texas. OnMonday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday,vice president Dick Cheney STAYED ON VACATION in Jackson,Wyoming. On Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday, Sec. ofState Condi Rice WENT ON VACATION in New York City andwent to a splashy Broadway musical and bought obscenelyexpensive shoes. She went shopping.How much simpler can it be for people to understand? Disasterstruck and no one in the Bush administration cared. If theycared, Bush and Cheney and Rice would have gone back towork. How can I watch 2 and a half hours of Sunday morningnews programs, where everyone is saying the region faceshuge problems and no one is still in charge and not one personasked "Where is Dick Cheney?" Gee, do you think this might bean appropriate task for the vice president? Why did he stay onvacation? Why did we not even see him until Saturdaymorning? Rumsfeld joined Bush on a political jaunt on Tuesdaywhen he should have been working on sending in the troops.Andy Card was also on vacation during this crisis.We've repeated this time and time again on Americablog, butastonishingly, the simplest, starkest fact about this disaster isnot getting out to the MSM. It's not the first question asked byreporters. Rice hasn't been asked why she stayed on vacation.Cheney is apparently being hidden because he hasn't evenoffered public words of sympathy for the thousands of deadand the million American citizens who have had their livesdevastated. The vice president hasn't said one word about thisnational tragedy. How can the MSM miss this? I can't evenimagine the venomous (and correct) calls for impeachment ifBill Clinton STAYED ON VACATION during the worst tragedy inour nation's history. And Bush is getting a free pass. This mustbe asked about again and again and again until they apologize.What went wrong?BUSH STAYED ON VACATION DURING THE WORST NATURALDISASTER IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY.CHENEY STAYED ON VACATION DURING THE WORST NATURALDISASTER IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY.RICE WENT ON VACATION DURING THE WORST NATURALDISASTER IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY.Why isn't this topic number one for every journalist worth theirsalt?
