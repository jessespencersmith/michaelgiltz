Few sports ever break into primetime the way
NASCAR has in the past decade. The pastime ofmiddle America, few people who followedNASCAR ever dreamed that the New York Timeswould be covering their events one day and thatdrivers would be stars in LA. But it happened.
Now, other rising sports hope to make the same
leap. But some extreme sports -- like themotocross and skateboarding events highlightedon the X Games -- seem to have peaked even asthey make inroads into the Olympics. Mixed
martial arts is clearly the new boxing, but it's so bloody and violent that MMA will probably not beembraced by the traditional media. Yet there is a sport that combines the heartland appeal ofNASCAR, the inherent danger of the X Games and the colorful personalities of MMA. It'sexploding in popularity worldwide and gaining more and more coverage on national TV channelslike ESPN (which has a section of its website devoted to the sport), NBC, FOX and its main channel
VERSUS. The sport? Bull riding.
The PBR (Professional Bull Riders)  is the group that oversees some 300 events in 5 countries,
including the US, Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Australia. (London looks like a possibility for next
season, but those five countries are stalwarts that produce top riders on the tour.) Last week, I
went back stage at the final PBR event of the season before the finals in Las Vegas taking place
over two weekends from October 31 through November 9. Getting up close to the action lets youknow how crazily dangerous bull riding can be. Talking with 19 year old Rookie of the Yearcontender Reese Cates -- who has blogged about his time on the tour for ESPN -- makes clear thatthe PBR has a whole crop of rising stars who are media savvy and ready to spread the fun of bullriding to a wider audience the way Jeff Gordon and others did for NASCAR.
Not convinced? Here are some reasons to love the PBR and bull riding.

<p>Michael Giltz: The Next Big Breakout Sport? Bull!
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/the-next-big-breakout-spo_b_137552.html[4/5/2009 1:17:22 PM]1. It's dangerous  -- Each rider has to try and stay on a bull for 8 seconds. A team of bull fighters
(not clowns; don't call men who risk their lives dozens of times a night clowns) are in place to draw
the bull away from a rider after he's done or bucked off. A lot of times the riders are so smooth it
looks routine. It's not. "This is the most dangerous sport in the world," says Cates, whose dad and
granddad rode bulls and whose mom competed in barrel riding (an event at rodeos). "You're
competing against something that's ten, 15 times your size and he doesn't care about anything but
getting you on the ground and doing his job."
2. The bulls are stars, too  -- Unlike the cruel sport of bullfighting in Spain -- recently featured
on 60 Minutes -- the bulls are not harmed in the PBR. In fact, watch it for five minutes and you'll
realize that the bull is just about the only person not in danger. Cowboys wear spurs, but they'redull-edged and don't pierce the skin of the bull (which is six times thicker than human skin). Bullsget a score just like the rider. In fact, the better and more aggressive the bull, the better score arider who stays on can achieve. And even if the rider is bucked off, the bull still gets a score -they're competing for Bull of the Year, just like the riders are competing for their own top title.Bulls win huge prizes at the end of the season and have fans who root for them. They're treated asthe valuable steers they are and put out to pasture after their career is over. Now hardcore PETAfans won't ever be satisfied, but most animal lovers will find the PBR celebrates the bulls, capturestheir personalities and treats them humanely.
3. Bull riding is perhaps the only professional sport where no one is guaranteed a
payday; not the rookies and not even the superstars  -- "This is the only professional sport
where we don't get paid just to show up," says Cates, an Arkansas native who is going to college in
Texas and studying ag business while riding on the tour. "You have to ride and you have to win towalk away with money. That's why you see guys riding with broke ribs and broke legs and stuff likethat - because they have families to feed. You're not going to get paid unless you're out here puttingyour life on the line riding bulls."
4. It's all-American -- They're cowboys, for gosh sakes. And just like the story of the West isn't
lily white but filled with immigrants and people of color, the PBR is just as diverse. Competitors
come from all over the world. Some are like the hardscrabble boxers of the 1950s, people who see asport like this as their only way out of poverty. Others are stars in their own country drawn by thelure of the US, the way Japanese baseball players come to the majors. Currently, some of thebiggest names in the sport come from Brazil, including the most-decorated rider in PBR historyAdriano Moraes (who is retiring) and Guilherme Marchi, the most consistent rider of the last fouryears and the man poised to win the World Title in Vegas. You'll see ads for trailer hitches andJack Daniels and smokeless tobacco if you go to a PBR event in person. But before you make anyassumptions about the audience, listen to them cheer for Marchi or some of the other Brazilians (afew of whom speak as little English as other cowboys speak Portuguese). "The only word inPortuguese I know is 'oi,'" admits Cates. "And I don't even know what that means." (It's akin to"hey.")
5. It's cheap  -- Regular season tickets range from $10 to $100 for the best seats in the house. The

Song Hits Radiosfinals in Vegas have tickets starting at $15. And it's a great sport to watch on TV. After one night,
you'll be judging the rider and the bull with the same authority you judged divers and gymnasts
during the Olympics. But seeing it in person is the best way to realize what a rush the sport can be.
6. It's more real than "The Real World"  -- Unlike other sports, the cameras are
EVERYWHERE at the PBR. They're right on top of the action, but then they follow the riders off
the field, backstage and into the locker room where sometimes they throw their equipment in
disgust, get treated for injuries, joke with friends, or take a quick moment to say a prayer and
thank God they're alive. I really hate watching athletes pray after making a touchdown or hitting a
home run (as if God cares) but it just seems natural to be grateful you're alive after facing a bull.
Athletes get upset but -- amazingly -- you rarely hear them curse, even when a 1500 pound bull is
coming right at them. "Well, you know, it's a family sport," says Cates. "Whenever you step up to
this level, you know that there's little kids at home watching you and there are kids in the stands.
The way I look at it is if I wouldn't say it in front of my mom or my little brother, I wouldn't say itanywhere else." You've got to think of your mom watching you at all times? He nods. "And she is."
So give the PBR a chance during the finals or next season, which stretches from January into
November and reaches all parts of the country. Or read the blog of Reese Cates  and get a glimpse
into what it's like to risk your life every week. "That's one thing that's so great about being a bullrider," he says. "You have to have heart, you have to have the fire in your eye whenever you showup. You have to want it and that's the way you get paid being a bull rider. You have to be tough."

I began watching the PBR about 3 years ago, my wife, my osn, and I enjoy watching it as a family. If
you have never been to a live event I highly recommend it, the riders are accessible and kids can havetheir pictures taken with them. The whole event is entertainment, it's more than just bull riding going onin the arena. The one thing I like about it is that the riders only get paid when they ride not for showingup and being a prima donna. This alone makes the riders WORK as hard as they can just to makewhat seems like forever 8 seconds, at least you know you're getting every penny of your entertainment
dollar. 
I hope the sport does expand, it's great family entertainment. Take the family to an event I guarantee
you;ll enjoy it.

But bull riding has been around forever and hasn't caught on as a mass appeal sport. So I don't seehow you will expect it to do so now. It could definitely be a regional thing like rodeo, perhaps. 
It is just like how networks keep trying to force soccer down our throats and roller derby has gone
through various unsuccessful incarnations.

Bull riding as part of the rodeo has been around forever. But rodeosare lengthy affairs and include calfroping and other events lots ofregular Joe animal lovers don't want to watch. But the rodeo is whereI first fell for bull riding. The PBR -- a separate tour devoted solely tothat event -- has only been around since 1992. By fcusing on bull
riding only, increasing the money to be won (people love big money events) and developing it
for TV, the PBR has exploded the sports popularity. It works really well on TV, it's been
expanding way beyond the heartland where millions of people attend rodeos every year) to
places like Vegas and New York City. In the last eight years, the PBR has gone from being
seen solely on basic cable channels like Versus to having more and more events carried on
ESPN, NBC and FOX. They've also got a crop of young, good-looking media friendly riderswho can help popularize the sport. Plus, it features lots of stars from Mexico, Brazil and otherLatin American countries which can appeal to the growing Hispanic audience in the US.NASCAR was around for a long time before it hit the primetime. Bull riding works great on TVand I believe it'll keep growing. Thanks for reading.

I had a nice steak at Michael Jordan's at Mohegan Sun in Connecticut before the PBR event and that'sas close as I ever want to get to a bull either. Thanks for reading.

It's about time PBR is recognized as a real sport. We have been following it for the past five years andgo the PBR event when it comes to San Antonio, TX., which has only been in the last two years.Already, I saw the increase in spectators from the previous year. It is exciting to watch. The competionbetween riders is enormous, and the bulls are scary and amazing to watch too. Sometimes I can't helpto think of those bulls as, steak on the hoof, though. The PBR!!!
