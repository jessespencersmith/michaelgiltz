            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT H U R S D AY,  A U G U S T  2 4 ,  2 0 0 6Jersey Boys *** 1/2Everything went wrong that could go wrong. I opened up my Playbilland there was a snowfall of notices announcing replacements. Two ofthe four Jersey Boys were out, and the guy who played their manager.But John Lloyd Young was there and that would be the onlydeal-breaker since he plays Frankie Valli and he's the one I want to seebefore the original cast is gone. So I stay. Then the first number beginsand the mikes give out. The show is delayed for 25 minutes while theytry to fix the audio. And even after they start, throughout theperformance there are brief moments when people's mikes don't workat all or only haphazardly. Then the couple next to me -- who've seenthe show twice already -- start chatting during several songs as ifthey're watching TV at home. And despite all of this I thought the showwas very good. The book is very substantial, unlike most jukeboxmusicals. And as others have pointed out, they use the music wisely.The struggling guys of act one sing all sorts of popular numbers inclubs and so on, but the Four Seasons hits are only heard in bits andpieces until 3/4s of the way through when they finally dig into thecatalog and it's a terrific release of tension. Young is exceptional asValli, somehow capturing the spirit of that falsetto without everseeming to resort to imitation or karaoke. It's gonna make a GREATmovie someday; I just hope they don't wait so long that Young can'ttake part.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
