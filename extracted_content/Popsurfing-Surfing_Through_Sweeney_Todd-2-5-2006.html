            <p>Newer PostOlder PostS U N D AY,  F E B R U A RY  0 5 ,  2 0 0 6Surfing Through "Sweeney Todd"Just saw the new Broadway production of Sweeney Todd starringMichael Cerveris and Patti Lupone. Terrific show -- one of Sondheim'sbest of course. And this take on it -- set ostensibly in a madhouse andwith the smallish cast doubling up on instruments -- was beautifullyfocused and well-directed. Every movement had a purpose, everyperformance was on the same page...and what delicious pies. Hard toimagine people complaining that Sondheim doesn't write "tunes," whatwith songs like "Not While I'm Around," "Pretty Women," "Johanna"and the show-specific numbers like "The Worst Pies in London," "ByThe Sea" (Lupone's highlight) and "The Ballad of Sweeney Todd."Cerveris and Lupone were great of course -- terrific chemistry, verydroll and always in service to the show. The find for me was ManoelFelciano as Tobias. He was wonderfully good as the narrator/Toby,giving a dangerous gleam to "Not While I'm Around" and generallybeing in tune with everything going on stage around him without beingdistracting or busy or calling attention to himself. But every time youdid look at him -- even if he was just playing an instrument -- you knewexactly what he was thinking and feeling. I saw him after the showlugging some suitcases and calling a cab but he had a distracted,unapproachable air so I didn't say, 'Great show.' But he's performingsolo tomorrow and next Monday and I don't want to miss that. A realtalent.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
