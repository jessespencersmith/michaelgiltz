            <p>We love everything about mystery novels, especially the whodunnits
and the brilliant, bumbling and simply persistent detectives and
private investigators who gather clues, bring all the suspects together in a
room and declare, “I’ve brought you all here tonight…” just as the lights go
out! It’s why we created our list of the 101 best mystery novels of all time. 
But a list celebrating the Sherlock Holmes and Miss Marples of the world
leaves a lot to be desired. What about the crime novel or brutal police
procedural? What about the spy novel with intrigue aplenty but more
derring-do than detection? What about the thrillers in which the person you
sympathize with is actually a serial killer?
So we’ve gathered 110 of the best thriller, crime and suspense novels of all
time. Gothic dramas, iconic secret agents, psychological thrillers that kept
you guessing—they’re all here. Let us know which ones you love, which
ones you’re going to read next and which thriller books we were crazy not
to include. Grab a martini—shaken, not stirred, of course—and enjoy. And if
you’re adding to your cart, don’t forget to shop local (we’ve included a few
fantas tic independent bookstores below, and you can also use this handy
tool from Bookshop to buy from an indie near you).
The Best Thriller, Crime and Suspense Books of All
Time
The T alented Mr. Ripley by Patricia Highsmith
Horrible people can become disturbingly sympathetic once you spend
time with them, whether it’s Norman Bates in Psycho or Jeff Lindsay’s
Dexter, the serial killer with good intentions. The brilliant Highsmith knew
this well, and perhaps her greatest creation, Tom Ripley, toyed with our
affections throughout five novels. “The Talented Mr. Ripley is certainly one
of the best if not the best thrillers of all time,” says author Karin Slaughter.
“Tom Ripley is not just a classic antihero, he is a precursor to so many
flawed men we’re meant to root for—from Don Draper to Tony Soprano.
Highsmith crafts him as a perpetual underdog, a striver that the reader
finds more relatable than the monied snobs he so desperately wants to be
a part of.” It’s a delicious irony at the heart of so many crime novels: you’re
not supposed to root for the criminal or vicariously enjoy someone
knocking off those people who really, really “deserve it.” And yet…

Winter’s Bone by Daniel Woodrell
Woodrell made his name with a series of novels he dubbed Country Noir,
tales of crime and survival set mostly in the Missouri Ozarks. He enjoyed
acclaim with 1986’s Under The Bright Lights and 2013’s The Maid’s
Version, but first among  equals is Winter’s Bone, which became an award-
winning film and consistently receives high praise. “It’s rare, maybe
100,000 to 1 shot, that a novel will succeed on every level—story,
characters, dialogue and description that rises to the level of poetry,” says
bestselling author James Patterson (Fear No Evil). “That’s what Daniel
Woodrell achieved with Winter’s Bone.” 
Live And Let Die by Ian Fleming
The James Bond series by Ian Fleming is more brutal, more blunt than the
movies they inspired—at least until the Daniel Craig era went back to the
source for inspiration. Given an initial boost by President John F. Kennedy,
the books and films about the spy with a license to kill have often been a
tantal izing introduction to the world of adults for generations of kids.
Acclaimed author Ken Follett (Never) was no exception. “At the age of 12, I
had read everything in the children’s library and I was admitted to the
grown-up section,” remembers Follett, who began with the Bond book that
remains his favorite: Live And Let Die. “I remember asking my father what a
martini was,” says Follett. “‘Some kind of drink,’ he said grumpily, clearly
having no idea. I could hardly wait to find out.”

In The W oods by Tana French
Why give this list the ungainly name of best thriller/crime/suspense novels?
Because French offers up all three at once in her debut work. In it,
detectives Maddo x and Ryan investigate the murder of a 12-year-old girl,
which (as will happen in crime novels) links to Ryan’s past. Author French is
deeply invested in the interior lives of her characters, which makes sense
since she was a working actress when this came out in 2007. That makes
her Dublin Murder Squad series and stand-alone books far more than thrill
rides, though thrill they do. Those looking to add up the clues or insist on
large-scale action scenes should look elsewhere. Those who realize that
unde rstandi ng our best friends or even ourselves can remain an eternal
mystery? You’re in for a treat.
Alias Grace by Margaret Atwood
One of the most acclaimed writers of our time, Atwood is not fond of
labels. Despite numerous novels set in dystopian futures and featuring
everything from a climate-ravaged world to genetically modified creatures
like the pigoon, she hated the label of science fiction. Atwood grudgingly
conceded to the term but even then preferred the more hifalutin label of
speculative fiction. Well, nuts. We say Atwood should embrace being a sci-
fi writer and a crime/suspense novelist to boot. Doubtless, she’d prefer we
call Alias Grace a work of historical fiction. Here, Atwood retells the true
story of a woman convicted in 1843 of murdering her employer and his
housekeeper. Atwood has revisited this story repeatedly, first in poetry,
then a TV movie in 1974 and finally this novel (which itself became an
acclaimed miniseries in 2017). Atwood changed her mind over the years
about whether the real Grace was guilty or not, but here, the conclusion is
tantal izingly vague. Whether or not this is historical fiction or a crime novel
or a murder mystery, it’s definitely art. And that means you don’t always get
a tidy label—or conclusion.

of All Time
Not A Penny More, Not A Penny Less by Jeffrey Archer
Whether you’re talking the George Clooney/Brad Pitt franchise or the 1960
Frank Sinatra/Rat Pack original, the Ocean’s Eleven movies have nothing
on this scam. In Not A Penny More, Not A Penny Less, four men are ripped
off by an unscrupulous businessman but have no legal recourse. So they
team up and use their unique skills (art dealer, Oxford don and the like) and
the villain’s many weaknesses (lust for a van Gogh, vanity, etc.) to scam the
money back. Exactly the money he stole: not a penny more, not a penny
less. It’s clever, fun and has a great twist, just like the Sinatra Ocean flick.
Politician turned novelist Lord Jeffrey Archer pulled off a trick almost as
good. He went from political disgrace in financial ruin to one of the world’s
most successful writers of all time, starting with this. Years later, when he
was jailed for perjury, Archer turned that into a best-selling prison diary,
too. Resourceful chap, just like his protagonists.
Those Bones Are Not My Child by Toni Cade Bambara
This staggering masterwork was edited and acclaimed by no less than
Nobel Prize winner Toni Morrison. Bambar a tackles the Atlanta child
murders of the late ‘70s. Instead of plunging into the mind of the killer or
watching the police try to track them down, Bambara brings to life the
families left shattered by the disappearance or death of a child. She shows
the women organizing to demand justice. She shows the world of Atlanta,
and indeed, of America. And she shows how justice is tinged by the color
of your skin. Bambara’s posthumous novel captures everything from disco
to the Iran hostage  crisis to the poison of class and racism. It became her
legacy when colon cancer cut her life too short at the age of 56.
The G irl With Th e Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson
This was a phenomenon and a passionate precursor to the #MeToo
movement—don’t forget, in Sweden, this book was originally titled Men
Who Hate Women. In it, a journalist teams up with the not-victim-but-
avenger Lisbeth Salander to expose the corruption of Swedish billionaires,
fanati cal secret Nazis, rapists, drug cartels and a few other baddies for
good measure. Larsson, who died before any of the books were published,
modeled his iconic heroine on everyone from Pippi Longstocking to
Modesty Blaise. Since he peppered his books with references to other
crime writers (like Sara Paretsky, Val McDermid and, of course, Agatha
Christie), it’s likely the girl with the dragon tattoo led readers to more of the
books on this very list.

All Time 
L.A. Confidential by James Ellroy
Hammett. Chandler. Macdonald. That’s the august company James Ellroy
joined with the L.A. quartet, four novels that raised his game considerably.
The Black Dahlia, The Big Nowhere, L.A. Confidential and White Jazz
cemented a reputation that grew even more with the Underworld USA
trilogy. But you have got to start somewhere, so why not L.A. Confidential,
the novel that in 1997 inspired one of the best crime films of all time? It
depicts a 1950s Los Angeles so corrupt and violent that Deadwood seems
like Disneyland. Riveting.
Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier
A Gothic tale. A haunted marriage. A powerful man and a weaker woman.
It’s a recipe for a psychological melodrama (loaded word, that!) and a
recipe for critical disdain. An immediate bestseller, du Maurier’s
masterpiece is now acclaimed as a classic, but it was a long time coming,
despite an Oscar-winning film adaptation and one of the great opening
lines of all time. “This book forever altered my perception of what crime
novels could be,” says author S.J. Watson (Final Cut). “I love the fact that
Rebecca—the title character!—exists only as an absence at the heart of the
book and also the fact that the narrator herself is unna med throughout.” Its
greatest accomplishment may be the fact that it’s now so clearly seen as
belonging to the thriller/suspense genre. While he appreciates the plotting,
Watson points out that it’s “also an exploration of power, of the men who
have it and the women who don’t, and the secrets told to preserve it.”
Black Wings Has My Angel by Elliott Chaze
Some people have favorite record labels, names they trust to deliver music
that will satisfy. The same is true for publishers, and none are better at
reissuing often obscure novels you didn’t know you needed than the New
York Review Books Classics. You simply can’t go wrong with anything they
put out, from the word-of-mouth sensation Stoner by John Williams (one of
the great publishing success stories of the 2000s) to the noir gem Black
Wings Has My Angel. In it, Jim Sunblade (what a name!) escapes from
prison, stumbl es into a dispassionate bad girl named Virginia and together
they plan the perfect heist. Watching it all go horribly wrong and
wondering when or if Jim will realize Virginia is not to be trusted AT ALL is
bleak fun of the highest order.
The Hunt Fo r Red October by Tom Clancy
No one expects a novel published by the modest Naval Institute Press to
set the bestseller lists on fire. But that’s what Clancy did with a book that
was half thriller, half owner’s manual (after reading his absorbingly detailed
descriptions of weaponry and machinery, many readers assumed they
were ready to pilot a military submarine). “I distinctly remember thinking it
was something special,” says author Jack Carr (The Devil’s Hand).
“Though I didn’t know it at the time, I was reading a work that would launch
a series of books, films, adaptations, spin-offs, video games and multiple
works of non-fiction in an enterprise that shows no signs of slowing down.
Crack it open today to be transported back to 1984, a time when Reagan
was in the White House and the Cold War was in full swing.”

Blacktop Wasteland by S.A. Cosby
How soon is too soon to name something a classic? Naturally, our list leans
toward novels that have been around a while. You don’t want to throw
around the word “classic” every time a new book captures your fancy. But
it’s not too soon to recognize the remarkable acclaim and success of S.A.
Cosby’s noir novels, especially Blacktop Wasteland from 2020 . Our hero
Bug Montag e is one of the best wheelmen around, but he’s done with that
life for good. Uh-huh. Then the bills pile up and a friend comes calling with
a can’t-miss caper, and Bug reluctantly agrees to do what he does best just
one more time. A rich novel that captures the lethal trap of poverty and
prejudice—and how one wrong choice can leave you with no choice at all
for the rest of your life.
Odd Tho mas by Dean Koontz
Sometimes, all it takes is a character. In this case, that character is the
delightfully offbeat Odd Thomas, a short-order cook who can see the
dead. They don’t speak to him, but they communicate…something. And
when they linger, Odd realizes it’s for a reason and sets out to right
wrongs. An unfailingly polite young man when this series began in 2003,
Odd is surrounde d by friends and loved ones who actually take his second
sight seriously, including his landlord, his girlfriend and even the chief of
police in their small town. Thank goodness, because when a stranger
comes to town practically swarmed by ghosts, Odd realizes something
very, very bad is about to happen—unless he can save the day.
The C ount Of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas
A classic tale of revenge about a man wrongly imprisoned, this is just one
of the many swashbuckling tales by Dumas and others that laid the
groundwor k for the classic modern thriller. “Edmond Dantès’ heroic escape
and subsequent triumph against his enemies is carried out in a series of
brilliant coups, by exploiting each of his enemies’ vulnerabilities (greed,
power, lasciviousness) in such a way that each villain brings about his own
downfall,” says author Katherine Neville (The Fire), who gleefully follows in
his footsteps. “A real tour de force that will never lose its literary power.”
Eileen by Otessa Moshfegh
Moshfegh grabs you at the start. Her narrator Eileen is trapped. Trapped by
an alcoholic father she must care for. Trapped in a miserable job at what
amounts  to a prison for boys (such are juvenile correction centers).
Trapped in a cycle of petty shoplifting and mordant humor and the
pointlessness of it all. And then, like the explosion of color in The Wizard
Of Oz, in walks the beautiful and enchanting Rebecca Saint John as the
new counselor for those wayward teens—and a new best friend for Eileen.
Shortlisted for the Booker Prize, this debut was so well done, most critics
didn’t even see it for the noir gem it was.
Out of Bounds by Val McDermid
A leader of Tartan Noir, McDermid’s hero in Out of Bounds  is Karen Pirie,
who is “smart and tenacious, and will follow any lead to find answers, even
though she usually has to go around her male bosses to get results,” says
Deb Leonard of Literati Books of Ann Arbor, Mich. “She’s a cold case
detective in Scotland who is called into the case after a teenager crashed
a stolen car. Meanwhile, she’s also investigating a mystery that is tied to a
terrorist bombing 20 years ago.”
The Si lence Of The Lambs by Thomas Harris
Yes, of course, the movie. But the novel! It’s the second of four books
centering on the magnetic, chilling serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The first,
Red Dragon, became an exceptionally good film called Manhunte r. This
one became a film for the ages, the first horror-tinged movie to win the
Best Picture Oscar. But the writing! Everyone from children’s author Roald
Dahl to meta-magician David Foster Wallace praised it to high heaven. Just
don’t expect to sleep until you finish it. And then don’t expect to sleep
easily.

The G oldfinch by Donna Tartt
Tartt arrived with a thunderclap via the murder-on-campus success of The
Secret History. But author Chris Pavone (The Paris Diversion) speaks up
for her Pulitzer Prize-winning The Goldfinch as equally belonging to the
world of crime fiction. The novel, triggered by a terrorist act and the almost
accidental filching of a painting, “is a sprawling masterpiece of suspense
that also happens to be a book about nearly everything: family and loss
and grief and despair and growing up and art and betrayal and many types
of love,” says Pavone. Since Tartt takes a good decade between releases,
it’s good that, as Pavone says, the novel is “very long (at 784 pages) but for
me, not nearly long enough. It’s a book I could read forever.”
Along Came A Spider by James Patterson
Patterson is in a league of his own. No other author has collaborated so
often with so many writers (and helped launch or reinvigorate their solo
careers). No other author has released so many successful bestsellers in
recent years. And none have so passionately donated and suppo rted
libraries, independent bookstores and the pleasures of reading. And none
of his many, many series for adults and kids or stand-alone thrillers have
proven as popular and enduring as the Alex Cross books. Launched in
1993 with Along Came  A Spider, they’ve shown a widowed father and
detective doing his damndest to balance work, family and the occasional
romance (though dating Cross is a sure-fire recipe to be put in danger).
Sure, he might miss Christmas Eve while battling terrorists, but Cross
always makes it up somehow. Action-packed but rooted in family and love,
it’s the very model of an ongoing series that delivers precisely what fans
hope for.
The G odfather  by Mario Puzo
I believe we have found a case where you can love a novel and still agree
the movie was even better. Keep in mind, author Puzo co-wrote the
screenplays for both The Godfather and The Godfather II, so he is
creatively key to the films. And the man owned the 1970s, what with the
Godfather franchise and his penning the screenplay for the best comic
book film of them all, Superman: The Movie. But it began with the 1969
novel, a book that made those cold ruthless people who destroyed their
souls somehow also seem glamorous if you weren’t paying close attention.
It cannily mixed in thinly disguised portraits of Frank Sinatra and real-life
mobsters and introduced us to ideas like omertà, Cosa Nostra and
consigliere to pitch-perfect effect. 
A Coffin For Dimitrios by Eric Ambler
James Bond gives his stamp of approval for this early British master of the
spy novel. In From Russia, With Love, Bond is seen reading The Mask Of
Dimitrios (a.k.a. A Coffin For Dimitrios) on a plane trip to Istanbul. Mind you,
Ambler didn’t write about professionals like 007. His heroes were
Hitchcockian characters—ordinary people who unexpectedly find
themselves immersed in a most dangerous game but rise to the occasion.
In this case, it involves a Balkan brew of assassination, drug dealing and
espionage. You can’t go wrong with any Ambler written until the war took
over his life in 1940. After that, the staunch anti-fascist ended up in the
army’s film unit and soon segued into the movies, where he wrote the
script for the film about the Titanic, A Night To Remember.

The L ast Good Kiss by James Crumley
James Crumley was a “writer’s writer,” which means his books never sold
that much, but boy were they good. Heck, when the legendary author Ray
Bradbur y wrote three mystery novels, he named the detective Crumley in
honor of the man! “[The Last Good Kiss] is the best private eye novel I’ve
ever read,” says author Dennis Lehane, just one of many to bow before it.
“Best first sentence, most satisfying ending, most beautifully written from
beginning to end.” In the novel, investigator C.W. Sughrue is lured away
from his job at a topless bar to find a wayward writer but ends up hunting
down a woman missing for more than a decade. Crumley died in 2008, but
not before enjoying a late-career appreciation from many quarters. “One of
the great pleasures of my life,” says Lehane, “was getting to meet Crumley
and tell him that his masterpiece forever changed my perception of what a
crime novel could be.”
Bluebird, Bluebird by Attica Locke
A major force in television, Locke has been a writer and producer on the
soapy pleasures of Empire, the Central Park Jogger miniseries When They
See Us and Little Fires Everywhere. If all that acclaimed work keeps her
from writing more crime fiction, it’s our loss. Her best achievement to date
is the launc h of a series about a one-time Texas Ranger drawn back to the
small town he left far behind. “A great mystery must have a well-developed
sense of place,” says Deb Leonard of Literati Books, who loves highlighting
diverse voices, especially when the author is so knock-out good. “This
book is set in East Texas, an area that has long been considered a law into
itself, with its murky bayous and bloodlines and only slightly-under-the-
surface racial tensions that have been simmering for generations. A great
writer.”

The E yre Affair by Jasper Fforde
If Monty Python tackled the crime genre, it would probably be interrupted
by the Spanish Inquisition. But before that happened, one can imagine
their antic brains cooking up something like The Eyre Affair, a world where
literary detectives protect classic novels from theft, abandonment and
even murder. It’s a favorite of Sarah Young of The Raven bookstore in
Lawrence, Kan. “Oh, boy, strap in when you pick up this book,” Young says.
“It’s a genre-bending, time-traveling, surrealistic alternative universe thriller.
The main character is Thursday Next, who transports through the ‘prose
portal’ into the novel Jane Eyre, where a criminal from her own world
kidnaps Jane and threatens to change the ending of the novel. Yeah, it’s
weird and fun and Jasper Fforde is a wicked genius.”
Double Indemn ity by James M. Cain
Sure, we could have included Emile Zola’s Thérèse Raquin, a much earlier
novel with a similar plot. But Cain’s hard-boiled classic has that one beat
when it comes to great dialogue dipped in arsenic. Zola captured the
poisonous suspicion of two people involved in a brutal crime. But Cain
nails the terrible cynicism of it all as we watch a woman convince a patsy of
an insurance agent to help kill her husband so they can both collect the
payout. It helps if you picture Barbara Stanwyck playing the woman in
perhaps the greatest noir film of all time.

The D eep Blue Good-By by John D. MacDonald
Popstar Jimmy Buffett once sang, “Travis McGee’s still in Cedar Key” in his
song “Incommunicado.” He’s capturing how fans of a character want to
keep them alive by re-reading a series or insisting others dive in. That way,
Holmes is always at 221-B; Miss Marple is happily ensconced at St. Mary
Mead; and McGee remains on his houseboat in Florida. “Great suspense,
surprising plot twists, and a nightmarish but very believable villain,”
remembers Jeff Lindsay (Fool Me Twice), who first read McGee’s story as a
kid. “The smell of saltwater and diesel is tangible, and the final image of
bad guy Junior Allen is like something from an awful dream.”
Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn
It’s remarkable how many books in the crime genre become part of
popular culture. Flynn’s massive blockbuster thriller still reverberates in the
mind as a novel about a scheming spouse…or perhaps a novel about how
the media loves a scheming spouse…or perhaps how we secretly love it
when the media piles on to a scheming spouse. Let’s face it, Gone Girl is a
roller coaster as the seemingly happy marriage of Nick and Amy Dunne
falls apart in the white-hot glare of a missing wife. Infidelity! Betrayal!
Hidden diaries! Faked diaries! Clues! False clues! You can’t trust anyone or
anyth ing in this masterful tale filled with unreliable narrators. Unreliable
except for Flynn, that is, who knows exactly what she’s doing.
The F orce by Don Winslow
A novelist of the first order, Winslow served in the Navy and worked as a
private investigator before turning to books full time. He’s created three
different ongoing heroes, numerous stand-alone titles and a trilogy that
serves as his greatest work so far (The Power of the Dog, The Cartel and
The Border). But maybe  the best way in is Winslow’s stand-alone novel The
Force, a riveting look at cops today that rivals Ed McBain and Joseph
Wambaug h at their best. Stephen King said, “Think The Godfather, only
with cops. It’s that good.” And as soon as you’re done, you’ll want to head
right to The Power Of The Dog. Trust us.
Nine Coaches Waiting by Mary Stewart
Romantic suspense doesn’t get any better than Mary Stewart, who rose
above the competition thanks to elegant prose and marvelous touches like
breaking this novel into nine sections (a la nine coaches) and sprinkling
poetry and other quotes throughout to telling effect. Invariably, women are
placed in danger but manage to solve a mystery while developing a
romance with some dashing fellow. “Here, we have a murder mystery, a
woman in jeopardy and a classic Gothic set in the remote Chateau Valmy
in the French Alps,” says Barbara Peters of The Poisoned Pen bookstore in
Scottsdale, Az. The main characters are “a handsome, darkly brooding
master and a young English governess looking after a 9-year-old heir while
probing at least one dark secret. Obvious comparisons are Jane Eyre and
even Cinderella.”
Dare Me by Megan Abbott
The smaller the world, the higher the stakes. Abbott proves this
conclusively in her novel about a high school cheerleading squad. The
team is ripped apart when a suicide leads the police to take a closer look
at Coach Colette and the young women vying for her praise. Friendship,
loyalty, trust, betrayal, suspense, desire, obsession—it’s all there if you’re
ready to take seriously the inner lives of young women determined to
succeed. Abbott is. And reading this, you will too.
The Adv entures of Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens
Yep, Dickens is one of the great crime novelists of all time. He has a gift for
devious characters and scheming and cruel deeds that cry out for justice
but don’t always get it. Nothing shows that better than the serialized novel
Oliver Twist, which still fascinates with its depiction of a school for criminals
and the way poverty can trap a person (even a little boy) into thievery.
While Fagin remains an ugly stereotype of anti-Semitism, the novel rises
above that flaw. The Artful Dodger is the most charming of pickpockets; Bill
Sikes the most terrible of men. And it’s all so delightful and suspenseful
and just plain fun it’s no wonder it was turned into Oliver! the musical. Who
wouldn’t break into song?
Room by Emma Donoghue
The darkest and best crime novels don’t plunge  us into depravity, they
shine a light into the shadows and let us confront them. That’s why a novel
about a woman who is abducted, trapped in a tiny space and then gives
birth to a little boy who spends the first five years of his life knowing
nothing but the room captured the imagination of the world. “Room is quite
simply one of the most powerful, most beautiful novels I’ve ever read,”
says author Kristin Hannah (The Four Winds). “It’s one of those stories
that linger, that stay with you, that make you see the world in a slightly
different way.” Donoghue moves beyond the simple “will they escape” to
grapple with the aftermath of trauma amidst a media frenzy.  “For thriller
fans, it may not be what you expect, and not what you’ve read before,”
says Hannah , “but it’s impossible to put down.”

Eye Of The Nee dle by Ken Follett
History will remember Follett as the writer of The Pillars of the Earth, which
turns the building of a cathedral in the 12th century into lofty suspense. But
before Follett detoured into architecture, he constructed some of the best
thrillers around. World War II was a favorite stomping ground, and his first
big success was Eye Of The Needle. Turned into a nifty film starring
Donald Sutherland, it shows a German spy discovering the truth about D-
Day. While trying to escape, he’s shipwrecked on a windswept island. Only
a lonely young wife stands between the spy and the greatest coup in
espionage. What makes this so gripping is how WWII may hinge on
whether she’s falling in love with him or he’s falling in love with her.
False Witness by Karin Slaughter
You might start with Slaughter’s first book, Blindsighted, the one that
enjoyed immediate acclaim and led to 16 novels in two cross-pollinating
series. Or pick up Cop Town, a sensational look at female officers in 1970s
Atlanta who have as many problems with their male co-workers as they do
with perps. (Where’s the movie? Where’s the sequel?) But we say just grab
her latest. False Witness is a thriller (dear god, yes) with a defense attorney
blackmailed into defending her very guilty client. Yet, like her best novels,
it’s so much more: a story of addiction, of two people dealing with trauma
in their own flawed ways, of life amidst a pandemic, of buried family
secrets. But leave no doubt:  you’re on the edge of your seat the entire
time.

Big Little Lies by Liane Moriarty
Suspense comes in many forms. Is your child bullying another kid at
school? Will you make friends with the new parents you meet when
bringing your kid to school? Will you want to? These everyday worries peel
back to reveal much darker truths in Moriarty’s massive bestseller that
became a hugely popular miniseries on HBO starring Reese Witherspoon
and Nicole Kidman. Domestic abus e, rape, a pact to keep a sudden
moment of violence secret, and before you know it, those big little lies
become very big indeed. It’s one of those books that happily expands what
the genre can encompass.
Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay
Serial killers can be chillingly magnetic (Hannibal Lecter), sweetly hapless
(Norman Bates), upwardly mobile and charming (Tom Ripley), or they can
be Dexter, a nice guy who—like Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation—
strives to simulate the emotions of other people as much as possible. He’s
nice to his sister, good at his job as a forensic analyst and when the need
to kill becomes overwhelming, Dexter channels it into taking out really,
really bad people like (other) serial killers, child molesters and those who
have evade d the long arm of the law. What’s not to like? Lindsay’s
memorable creation turned into eight alliterative novels, an eight-season
award-winning TV series starring Michael C. Hall, an animated series and
now a 10-episode Showtime revival called Dexter: New Blood. Even when
Lindsay wrote Dexter Is Dead, he was no more successful at offing the
man than Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was with Holmes. It proves once again
that great characters never die.
Expensive People by Joyce Carol Oates
Just the third book in a remarkable career, Expensive People came out in
1968. Her next work would win the National Book Award and clearly, Oates
never looked back. Here, Oates delivers a Gothic tale in the voice of a
chubby , unloved boy in an upper-middle-class family who calmly tells us he
is a murderer. Otessa Moshfegh (Death In Her Hands) still recalls the thrill
of first reading it. “This was one of the most exciting novels I picked up
when I was a young writer, and has the best opening of all time,” says
Moshfegh. “It’s a fictional memoir-cum-confession of a murderer who
happens to be an 18-year-old boy with an uncanny intelligence and the
complex misery that results from affluence and neglect.” With 60-plus
novels, 40-plus short story collections, 11 novellas and more, Oates can
clearly do it all, including thrillers.
Swamp Sister by Robert Edmond Alter
Gold Medal Books revolutionized publishing by launching a series of
paperback originals in the 1950s. For all the big names it generated, Gold
Medal also produced some great works that came and went without
garnering their due. Before his death in December 2021, we asked author
Andrew Vachss (Carbon) his favorite crime fiction. He pointed to this novel
as proof positive. “Ignored by the literati, relegated to “pulp” status by his
(perhaps forced) choice of publishers, Robert Edmond Alter’s mastery of
plot, character and interstitial tissue was unpa ralleled for its era,” said
Vachss. “And half a century on, it still holds its ground. Powerfully. Doubt
me? Try Swamp Sister. It won’t take you long to read, but you’ll remember it
forever.”
Flood by Andrew Vachss
And speaking of Vachss, one must rank the late author’s passionate
crusade against child abuse in the real world as the most important work
he did. But that advocacy extended to the white-hot urgency of his novels,
and they’re all the better for it. Author Barry Eisler (The Chaos Kind) was
immediately grabbed by Flood, the debut novel of this lawyer and one-
time juvenile prison director. “I first read it in 1989, then immediately blew
through the rest of the Vachss oeuvre (which was relatively small then, but
massive now),” says Eisler. “The only fictional aspects of Vachss’s ultrahard-
boiled novels are the dark, damaged characters populating them, and
even these, it’s clear, are based on people Vachss has known. But the
settings (typically the rancid underbelly of New York City) and the plots
(typically involving sociopaths who prey on children, and their familiars in
the civilian world) are all from the hard path walked by Vachss himself.”
Coma by Robin Cook
No, Coma didn’t invent the medical thriller. It just feels like it did. Cook
struck a nerve in the paranoid 1970s with his story about a female medical
stude nt uncovering a creepy plot to induce comas in patients so their
organs can be harvested for the black market. The novel was a runaway
bestseller perfectly in tune with an era that produced other elaborate
paranoias about faked moon landings and aliens among us. The film
version gave fellow thriller author Michael Crichton his biggest hit as a
director, and Cook never looked back, delivering new medically tinged
thrillers to keep patients on their toes right up to this year’s Viral.
Clockers by Richard Price
When a crime novel is so good even mainstream critics feel obliged to
review and praise it, they invariably dance around the truth. Clockers, they
say, is a depiction of modern society, a dissection of our social ills, a novel
with a broad canvas that uses the conventions of a crime novel to uncover
greater truths. Or, as we might say, Clockers is the sort of crime novel that
does exactly what the best crime novels have always done: It tells a
gripping story with great characters, intense plotting and the highest of
stakes. Price captures the workaday dynamics of a small drug gang in New
Jersey and how it’s as much a part of the community as the local cops, the
small business owners and the kids playing on the streets. If that makes
you think of HBO’s The Wire, it should. Bonus: the novel was turned into
one of director Spike Lee’s best films.
The D ay Of The Jackal by Frederick Forsyth
The 1970s was a peak period for thrillers, and this classic by Frederick
Forsyth is a major reason why. It was dismissed by publishers for one very
simple reason: How could anyone sit on the edge of their seats about an
attempted assassination of French leader Charles de Gaulle when the
entire world knew de Gaulle was very much alive and well and living in
Paris? A U.K. publisher took a chance, word of mouth was immediate and a
modern classic was born. Jeffery Deaver (The Midnight Lock) relishes it
still. “We follow a brilliant, amoral assassin as he moves closer and closer
to his target, while our hero, a modest French police officer, doggedly
pursues,” says Deaver. “This is my go-to model for an unstoppable roller
coaster of a read.”
The F irm by John Grisham
No one has ever owned the legal thriller the way Grisham does. Despite
nume rous novels on other subjects like baseball and Christmas , the law is
his bread and butter. What made his second novel The Firm such a
breakout? Is it the too-good-to-be-true dream job that turns out to be a
poisoned apple? Is it the action that escalates slowly and inexorably but
always believably? Perhaps it’s just the delicious pleasure of realizing even
lawyers can’t trust other lawyers. Grisham fights for the underdog in many
novels (and in real life, by supporting the Innocence Project). So the legal
system can sometimes work, poorly and creakily, but in The Firm you know
it’s usually working for the bad guys.
Dead U ntil Dark by Charlaine Harris
When Harris combined the conventions of crime families with the world of
vamp ires and tossed in a psychic waitress from the small town of Bon
Temps for good measure, she gave a fresh spin to both horror and crime. “I
remember when I first read this quirky vamp ire thriller long before it
became the inspiration for the hit HBO series True Blood,” says Young of
The Raven bookstore, who loved watching our heroine Sookie Stackhouse
“trying to navigate a world where vampires have come out of the shadows
to mingle with the rest of society. Harris’s books always have a tinge of
darkness, and this first entry in the Southern Vampire Mysteries is a wild
ride.”
Mystic River by Dennis Lehane
Lehane could easily be on this list for his terrific Kenzie & Gennaro series,
the books that immediately marked the writer as a major talent. Or why not
the Joe Coughlin trilogy set against Prohibition, a police strike and with
stops in Cuba and Tampa, Fla.? Lehane is one reason we’ve limited most
authors to just one book; otherwise we’d run out of room too quickly. And
if you’re going to pick just one Lehane novel, you’re going to pick Mystic
River, the story of three childhood friends whose lives are forever
shattered when one of them is abducted by child molesters. Twenty-five
years later, a brutal murder brings the three of them back into each other’s
lives—even though the trauma of that long-ago tragedy meant they were
inextricably bound forever. A classic.
The B one Collector by Jeffery Deaver
A villain with sadistic flair who brings New York City to its knees. A tortured
and brilliant quadriplegic hero considering suicide. And enough high-tech
toys to make C.S.I. jealous. Some books (and some characters, like The
Bone Collector’s Lincoln Rhyme) seem ready-made for the movies—it’s no
surprise Deaver is one of the few Americans authorized to write a new
adve nture for James Bond. But an unsatisfying film in 1999 and a one-and-
done TV series last year prove it’s not so easy to capture the “cinematic”
verve of even the best modern thrillers. Maybe the best movie-ready
books are really books the movies aren’t ready for yet. If you want these
thrills, you’ll just have to start reading. And don’t worry, Deaver has
delivered 15 so far, including 2021’s The Midnight Lock.
Fingersmith by Sarah Waters
Waters is a bestselling, acclaimed author in the U.S., but she looms even
larger in the U.K. And Fingersmith is where fans of crime novels on any
continent should begin. Romantic suspense, Dickensian twists and more
abound in this Victorian-era thriller that’s an ideal marriage between a
classic cliffhanger and a very modern sensibility. An orphan raised to
thievery a la Oliver Twist, a young woman seduced into an elopement,
heroin addiction, a madhouse, lies, lies and more lies all work to
remarkable effect. Like the best thrillers, Fingersmith works so well not just
because of its clever plotting but because that skill is combined with
characters who are so real.
When  The Sac red Ginmill Closes by Lawrence Block
Ironically, crime writers are terrible at killing off their famous creations.
Block thought he was done with the alcoholic ex-cop Matthew Scudder
after five novels. Ahh, but then a casual promise to deliver a Scudder short
story led to an idea, and soon Block delivered When The Ginmill Closes, a
book author Don Winslow said inspired him to write. This novel took
Block’s writing to new heights thanks to a tale where Scudder races to
discover who robbed a mob-owned bar before the cops get to the guy
first. “The plot is terrific, the ending…well, it’s one of the best ever,” says
Winslow. “But what makes the book for me is the writing.  Block is a
master, not only a superb technician but a genuine poet. What Chandler
was to L.A., Block is to New York.”
Snap by Belinda Bauer
Some writers offer a variation on a theme. They have their protagonist, a
familiar setting, various elements you can depend on. Other writers are
shape-shifters, like Belinda Bauer. She’s dazzled since her debut in 2009,
right up to this year’s Exit. And Snap is no exception, with its psychological
depth making it the rare crime novel to be longlisted for the Booker Prize.
In it, a little boy’s mother leaves him in charge as she goes for help when
their car breaks down. She never returns, and a few years later, the
teenager is still in charge, trying to keep his siblings away from social
services while doing a little burgling on the side to stay afloat. Thoroughly
engaging on its own terms, this quietly riveting story of survival becomes
unbe arable suspense when the boy’s story gets entangled with a
compulsive criminal and a new detective determined to track the man
down. Delightfully unpredictable, but that’s Bauer for you.
The D aughter Of Time by Josephine Tey
It’s the coldest of cold cases: a murder that took place centuries ago and
everyone knows the killer. Didn’t Shakespeare make clear Richard III was
the villain who had those two innocent princes killed in the tower? Well,
writer Josephine Tey’s quietly unconventional masterpiece follows a
modern police officer who wonders if the facts actually point to the hated
King after all. Tey may be the least well-known of the major crime writers of
the 20th  century, but her genius is evident. “This is the book that made me
realize that the history we’re given isn’t a neat collection of objective facts,”
says author Tana French. “It’s selective, it’s skewed, it’s shaped and re-
shaped over time to fit various shifting narratives and agendas. I’m a lot
more careful about checking sources—not just for history, but for news—
since I read this book.”
The Thi rty-Nine Steps by John Buchan
“What are the 39 steps? The 39 Steps are an organization of spies…”
BANG! Here, we’re quoting an Alfred Hitchcock film, perhaps the
prototypical Hitchcock thriller, about an innocent man on the run. Oscar-
winner Robert Towne says it’s no exaggeration to say all escapist
entertainment began with that classic movie. And (are you still with us?)
that movie found its inspiration from the 1915 Thirty-Nine Steps written by
Buchan. It was an instant smash hit thanks to an anti-German sentiment
quite popular during World War I, a cliffhanger narrative that betrayed its
beginnings as a magazine serial and a compelling tale of spies infiltrating
merry olde England. Curiously, the book has been adapted many, many
times, but rarely faithfully, starting with the Hitchcock film, numerous radio
adap tations and even a comical stage version that proved a long-running
hit in London and on Broadway. A new version for Netflix starring Benedict
Cumbe rbatch will likely take as many liberties—and be just as entertaining.
Wher e Are The Children? by Mary Higgins Clark
Rightly called the Queen of Suspense, the late Clark was hugely popular in
the U.S. for almost 40 years, but she looms even larger in France, which
has a respect for the “policière” the States have been slower to embrace.
Clark, who once modeled alongside a young Grace Kelly, wrote short
stories before working in radio. But the moment she attempted a suspense
novel in 1975 with Where Are The Children?, success was immediate and
permanent. This novel set the standard with its story of a woman whose
life is riven by the shocking deaths of her two children. She changes her
identity, moves across the country to escape those ghosts, begins a new
life with a new husband and new kids, and then looks out the window one
morning to realize the children are gone. Again. How can you not read to
find out what happe ns next?

Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (Blade Runner) By
Philip K. Dick
A landmar k work of science fiction both as a film and novel, Do Androids
Dream of Electric Sheep? is set in a near-future Los Angeles and uses the
Philip Marlowe-Sam Spade template to grapple with the idea of what it
means to be human. A bounty hunter is tasked with “retiring” six androids
who escaped into the general population and are difficult to spot since
they look just like everyone else. The police say “retired” because
andr oids can’t be killed—they’re not really alive, are they? Here, you’ve got
a police force that’s sometimes as much of a threat as the criminals, and a
feeling you’re not being told everything you need to know, just with robots,
flying cars and a post-apocalyptic future that proves the detective genre is
as timeless as ever.
The Surg eon by Tess Gerritsen
Like any parent, Gerritsen’s mom and dad thought a writing career was a
dicey proposition. So Gerritsen became a doctor and started practicing in
Hawaii. But writing kept calling to her. After a string of romantic thrillers,
Gerritsen took a page from fellow doctor Robin Cook and turned to
medical thrillers, launching her to hardcover and leading to her first New
York Times bestseller. But she really hit paydirt with The Surgeon, which
blossomed into the Rizzoli & Isles series of crime novels. They pair the
wise-cracking and confident police detective Jane Rizzoli with the brilliant
but socially bumbl ing medical examiner Dr. Maura Isles. Historical fiction
and other thrillers are on tap from Gerritsen as well, but we’re not done
with Rizzoli & Isles yet (especially since the TV series concluded). Happily,
neither is Gerritsen. A new R&I book titled Listen To Me is coming to
shelves July 2022.
The K iller Inside Me by Jim Thompson
Hardboiled is a great word, but it doesn’t do justice to the bleak vision of
Thompson. A hardboiled egg is soft on the inside, but a Thompson novel is
hard through and through. His life was a struggle right up to the end when
alcoholism took its toll. But back in 1952, Thompson delivered The Killer
Inside Me, a Dexter-like tale of a small-town deputy sheriff with a
sadomasochistic urge he calls the sickness. One of his masterpieces
(along with The Grifters and Pop. 1280), Killer opened the floodgates. After
taking three or four years between books, Thompson in a frenzy delivered
two in 1952, five in 1953 and another five in 1954 before collapsing back to
one every year or so. Read them, if you dare.
Conviction by Denise Mina
When Reese Witherspoon, the New York Times and your favorite local
bookstore guru praise a thriller, maybe it’s time to jump in? The timely hook
of a true-crime podcast is just the start for this page-turner that includes a
trophy wife with a secret past, a burnt-out musician sidekick, a sunken
yacht, an unde pendable husband and bad people in pursuit. Not to
mention Mina’s gift for a humorous skewering of modern life. It should
however come with a warning label: As Leonard of Literati Books puts it,
“Don’t pick up this book unless you plan to forgo meals and sleep until you
finish it!”
A Perfect Spy by John Le Carré
We put Le Carré’s novel Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy on our list of the best
mysteries of all time because it’s riveting to watch George Smiley ferret out
a mole in Britain’s MI5 by sitting and thinking. It’s a true mystery, even
though Le Carré is usually classified differently. Well, A Perfect Spy may be
one of the greatest thrillers ever written, but we could just as easily file it
unde r “memoir.” Le Carré drew deeply upon the relationship he had (or
lacked) with his own father, a con man that hobnobbed with violent London
gangsters the Kray brothers, made and lost fortunes and charmed
everyone within a mile of his magnetism. Author Jeffery Deaver (The
Midnight Lock) concurs: “No one writes about espionage like this author,”
says Deaver. “But I’ve picked it because it is also one of the most
engrossing—and harrowing— portraits of a father-son relationship I’ve ever
read. It’s not for the faint of heart, and that warning is not because of car
chases and shootouts.”
The Ni ghtingale by Kristin Hannah
Without warning, every once in a while, it seems like everyone you know—
everyone—has read, is reading or is about to read the same book. In 2015,
that book was The Nightingale, a World War II novel about two estranged
sisters resisting the Nazi invasion of France. One secretly shelters Jews,
including a neighbor’s child she hides in plain sight as one of her own. The
other joins the French Resistance and devises a plan to spirit away
strande d Allied pilots to neutral territory. Like the best thrillers, you’re
sucked in not by plot twists or the high drama of war but by the characters
who become so real to you that their fate is akin to your own.
Slow Horses by Mick Herron
“Slow horses” are the screw-ups of the British security service MI5. After
royally messing up in one way or another, such agents simply can’t be
trusted to do serious work or be dumped back into the real world, so
they’re relegated to disgraced MI5 branch Slough House to push papers
around. But these Dirty Dozen-like people are determined to redeem
themselves and, in the first of eight novels, that means rushing to rescue a
man kidnapped and threatened with a beheading live on the internet. It’s
being adap ted into a series for Apple TV+ starring Gary Oldman, who gave
one of the best performances of his career in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.
Since many call Herron a worthy heir to Le Carré, the casting is perfect.
Rules Of Prey by John Sandford
A long-running series is a special challenge, something only writers who
have achieved (or attempted) can fully appreciate. Sandford (the
pseudonym for Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist John Camp) accomplished
it with the 31-and-counting Lucas Davenport novels, starting with the first,
Rules of Prey. “The characters resonate as human beings who grow
throughout the series, the plots are so strong and compelling, and the
writing is absolutely solid,” says author Nora Roberts (The Becoming), who
herself is at 53 books and counting in her In Death series. The hero, Lucas,
begins as a rule-breaking detective in Minneapolis irresistible to women, a
la private eyes of old. Lucas will become happily married while working on
a special assignment for the governor, but somehow, he remains
believably the same man he was at the start.
True Grit by Charles Portis
Let this stone-cold classic stand-in for all the great Westerns that involve
crime-fighting, thrills and suspense. They just aren’t usually narrated by a
14-year-old girl so distinctive in natur e that you’ll never forget her. But the
two films based on it don’t hold a candle. Author Jasper Fforde (The
Constant Rabbit) insists this belongs in a celebration of thrillers. “Mattie
does not seek blood redress, she seeks justice—to see Chaney “hanged at
Judge Parker’s convenience” back home at Little Rock,” Fforde says. “A
revenge story, a manhunt, a thriller, a story of trust, love, bravery, duty and
tenacity—True Grit has it all.”
The B ig Blowdown by George Pelecanos
Pelecanos has done so much. He’s created multiple characters who’ve
powered their own series. He was a key contributor to HBO’s The Wire,
arguably the greatest crime show in TV history. (Sorry Sopranos fans; it’s
true.) And he took part in The Pacific, Treme and The Deuce to boot. But
Pelecanos went for broke with the D.C. Quartet, four novels that bring D.C.
alive, starting in the 1940s with The Big Blowdown. A Greek diner is
targeted for a shakedown by organized crime and the damaged anti-hero
Peter Karras sees a shot at redemption. Like the nuclear blast that gives
this book its title, Pelecanos leveled the competition.
Killing Floor by Lee Child
As long as Greyhound stays in business, you can be certain the very tall,
very intimidating, very not-Tom-Cruise character Jack Reacher will continue
arriving in new small towns to right wrongs, heading into the sunset or
wherever he suspects trouble is next waiting.“I say Jack Reacher is 1949’s
Shane riding into town on a bus instead of a horse,” says Barbara Peters of
The Poisoned Pen. With the pseudonymous Lee Child handing the reins to
his younger brother Andrew, nothing should upset a franchise that, as
Peters says, “combines the comforting pull of a series with a brand new
setting, story and cast every book. It’s genius!”
The R ound Ho use by Louise Erdrich
One of our best writers, Erdrich is also one of our best chroniclers of crime,
violence, poverty and its impact on individuals and communities. An
enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, Erdrich
finds rich material amidst life on the reservation in North Dakota. Fiction,
poetry, children’s books, nonfiction—the Pulitzer-Prize winner has done it
all. But the Justice Trilogy is a keystone of her career, encompassing
Plague of Doves, LaRose and smack dab in the middle is 2012’s The
Round House. It shows a 13-year-old boy frustrated that the police aren’t
looking more seriously into a horrific attack on his mother. Disastrously, the
kid takes matters into his own hands, with the help of friends and a stolen
rifle.  Justice is far, far away but a riveting story and art is right at hand.
Mission to Paris by Alan Furst
Have you ever wanted to travel back in time? Furst has literally done it.
Since 1988 and The Polish Soldier, he’s mentally transported himself to
Europe right before and during World War II. Warsaw, Paris during the
Occupation and Bucharest all come alive in a series loosely dubbed Night
Soldiers that encompasses 15 novels and counting. Only the familiar
backdrop and Furst’s talent for recapturing a lost era truly links most of
these books, which can be enjoyed and read in any order. But taken as a
whole, it will soon be seen as a monumental achievement and one not just
for fans of espionage—though fans of espionage should eat it up. Why
Mission to Paris as our choice? It’s certainly a peak achievement, but the
depiction of the City of Light in all its desperate glamor as war looms is
just…irresistible.
Mother Love by Domini Taylor aka Roger Longrigg
The author Roger Longrigg was marvelously prolific. Under various pen
name s, he produced erotic fiction, mysteries (as Frank Parrish), spy novels
(as Ivor Drummo nd), historical novels, a horse-racing thriller and Mother
Love, the story of a young English lawyer named Kit Vesey. Kit’s mother
Helena simply could not handle the fact that Kit might be friends with her
ex-husband and the man’s new wife. So, Kit keeps it a secret, having no
idea his mother is truly mad, already a killer and will surely kill again if she
discovers the truth. “Both funny  and chilling, this is a terrifyingly plausible
story of the deadly danger that can grow in a family’s shadows in the name
of ‘just tell a white lie to get along,’” says author Kate Quinn.
Sacred Games by Vikram Chandra
Thrillers have long enjoyed “exotic” backdrops, with dashing heroes jet-
setting to glamor ous locales around the world. Thankfully, in recent
decades, we’ve begun to appreciate crime novels written by the writers
who actually live there. In Chandra’s thriller, you don’t visit Mumbai, you are
immersed in it. You get to know Inspector Sartaj Singh, a member of the
Mumbai  police force isolated from his co-workers by his Sikh faith. You
learn to fear the Godfather-like overlord Ganesh Gaitonde. And amidst a
nerve-wracking attempt by Singh to snag this most-wanted criminal before
the man gets away (or someone else gets the credit), you begin to feel in
your bones the world they live in. Masterful.
In A Lonely Place by Dorothy B. Hughes
In this 1947 classic, a would-be screenwriter is helping a detective track
down the serial killer stalking women in post-war L.A. But the women who
know him best begin to suspect he knows a little too much about how a
psychopath might behave. You wouldn’t think a novel from 1947 would so
completely upend the passive role of women in noir, but that’s why author
Megan Abbott (The Turnout) has championed In A Lonely Place for years.
“It anticipates Patricia Highsmith’s The Talented Mr. Ripley and a deluge of
serial killer novels that followed, but—for my money—Hughes outsmarts
them all,” Abbott says. “It’s a riveting, seductive page-turner as well as,
more deeply, a fascinating, pointed and darkly funny  exploration of toxic
masculinity.”
What the D ead Know by Laura Lippm an
It was this 2007  stand-alone thriller that finally landed Laura Lippman on
the New York Times bestseller list and placed her in the front ranks of the
very best thriller writers working today—and that’s a very crowded field, as
this list makes clear. In What the Dead Know, not one but two girls go
missing from a mall. Decades later, a woman involved in a hit-and-run
accident claims to be one of those girls, though her story is frustratingly
vague and filled with holes. A detective assigned to the case needs to gain
her trust while figuring out why so much of what she says doesn’t seem to
make sense.“This book haunts you long after you’ve closed the pages,”
says Kathy Harig of the Mystery Loves Company bookstore in Oxford, Md.
“It’s a riveting domestic crime thriller from an author who just keeps getting
better and better.” Page-turning? Oh yes. But also notably infused with an
air of compassion often lacking in built-for-speed thrillers.
Sleeping With Strangers by Eric Jerome Dickey
Should the next James Bond be played by Idris Elba? Chiwetel Ejiofor?
Instead of waiting around for a casting change, the late author Dickey
simply wrote his own globe-trotting adventure with a Black man at its
center. Mind you, Gideon is a freelance assassin, rather than one hired by
the government. And he might be colder than the famously cold Bond—his
name  comes from the Bible a preacher was clutching as Gideon gunne d
the man down, for example. But this glamorous, tense, exciting novel (the
first in a series of five) is pure escapist fare. When Gideon heads to London
for a new job, he’s unaware another gun-for-hire has been given a new
target: Gideon. If he knew, Gideon would still likely be more worried about
the three women trying to nail him down with a little commitment. Cancer
took Dickey too soon last year, although he left behind some 30 novels
and a winning killer named Gideon. To heck with Bond, maybe Idris Elba
should just play him.
Rogue Male by Geoffrey Household
In 1939, this iconic thriller by Household was a wish-fulfillment for millions
of people around the world. In it, a professional hunter toys with the idea of
offing a brutal dictator (maybe Hitler, maybe Stalin—it’s left vague). He has
the man in his sights when the country’s security finds him and brutally
beats him. Somehow escaping, the hunter makes it back to England,
where the secret agents of the dictator show up, still determined to
execute him once and for all. “It’s a brilliant cat-and-mouse thriller,” says
Peters of The Poisoned Pen. “It’s also a clear inspiration for Frederick
Forsyth’s blockbuster thriller The Day of The Jackal.”
The Yi ddish Policemen’s Union by Michael Chabon
The title alone should be enough to entice a reader. And since Chabon
gloriously celebrated comic books with his Pulitzer Prize-winning The
Amazing Adventures of Cavalier & Clay, you suspected someday he’d get
around to the crime novel. Although maybe you didn’t expect it to be an
alternate history sci-fi crime novel where World War II didn’t end quite the
way we know, JFK lived and married Marilyn Monroe and when the state of
Israel collapsed, a colony of Jews were given a temporary home in a
district of Alaska. With us so far? Don’t worry. It’s pure noir, with a detective
who’s facing a dead-end in his marriage and career and discovers a chess
prodigy was murdered in the hotel room next door. When the authorities
tell our hero not to investigate, well, that’s when things get interesting.
Chabon doesn’t transcend genre; he celebrates it.
 
Tourist Season by Carl Hiaasen
OK, maybe  journalists have a soft spot for other journalists turned
successful writers. On the other hand, absolutely everyone loves Hiaasen’s
comic romps. Long before Florida Man became a thing, this Florida man
was turning the Sunshine State into the kookiest, funniest, weirdest place
on earth. Tourist Season is typically nutty , with eco-terrorist organization
Las Noches de Diciembre determined to save Florida’s environment from
total destruction by creating chaos with kidnappings, murders and related
mayhem. That should keep the tourists away!
The G irl On The Train by Paula Hawkins
The breakthrough novel by Hawkins was lazily compared to Gone Girl,
dismissed by some as misogynist because its main female character is a
mess and then treated suspiciously for being so wildly successful. Put all
that aside (along with an unsatisfying film version) and what remains is a
classic thriller. It plays with multiple unreliable narrators, enough twists for a
rollercoaster and provides a terrific update of the classic paranoia of
Gaslight—justified paranoia, just to be clear.
The F riends of Eddie Coyle by George V. Higgins
Director Quentin Tarantino is threatening to stop making movies after
delivering one more film. Well, in our opinion, his tenth and final film should
be a remake of The Friends of Eddie Coyle. It’s a classic crime novel by
Higgins that put Boston on the map for noir back in 1970. The dialogue is
sterling, the black humor right up Tarantino’s alley and the story of a
criminal who can avoid prison if he gives up one of his more powerful
associates is tense, riveting and filled with so many great characters that
everyone Tarantino has ever worked with will get a plum role. Hailed
immediately as a classic and guess what? They were right.
Above Suspicion by Helen MacInnes
It would be surprising if Helen MacInnes didn’t write espionage thrillers.
Her husband was an academic who doubled as a spy for MI6 while
ensconced at Oxford and then Columbia University in the U.S. They toured
Europe between wars, and she was so appalled at the rise of Nazis and
fascism that MacInnes took copious notes, determined to write something
that would alert the world to the dangers of Hitler, et al. A small push from
her husband and MacInnes was off, producing a novel roughly every two
years from 1941 until the year before her death in 1985. Like Hitchcock, she
loved placing innocent people in the middle of intrigue, like the newlyweds
in Above Suspicion, who were asked to casually check in on a spy
unde rcover in Austria. Events do not transpire calmly. “Helen MacInnes
was the queen of the mid-20th century espionage thrillers,” says Sarah
Young of The Raven bookstore. “Her novels are stunningly good, and
Above Suspicion is one of the best.”
Spoonbenders by Daryl Gregory
Here’s the pitch: Spoonbenders is like the Redford-Newman movie The
Sting, but with psychics. And a cute dog. And a raygun straight out of Buck
Rogers! It’s so unclassifiable and fun you might find it at the bookstore filed
unde r fiction or mystery or even sci-fi, but you should definitely find it now
and start reading. It tells of the Telemachus family, who were exposed as
telekinetic frauds  on The Mike Douglas Show in the 1970s. Now it’s the
1990s and this sad-sack group is burdened by the memory of what might
have been. Oh, and they’re burdened by actual psychic powers. (They
weren’t all faking it.) In this winning, funny  and grounded novel, the rough
life of the Telemachus family is beset by dangers like the Mafia, shadowy
government agencies and even the allure of online dating. It’s a joyride,
but it’s also aching and lovely and sweet and filled with memorable
characters. Spoonbenders is a cult favorite but that will change the minute
Hollywood wises up and turns it into a movie.

The B lank Wall by Elizabeth Sanxay Holding
Holding is celebrated, at least by aficionados. In the 1940s, no less than
Raymond Chandler sa id she was the best suspense writer of them all.
Recently, the Library of America included her in an omnibus collecting four
of the best thrillers by women from the 1940s. Holding keeps getting
rediscovered when she should be a permanent part of the pantheon. Take
The Blank Wall: Anyone with a pulse will thrill to this story of a woman
during WWII doing Mrs. Miniver one better when it comes to protecting her
family. “Yes, it’s one of the great lost classics of noir,” says author Megan
Abbott. “But we also see, more discreetly, her sneaking pleasure in
navigating the dark underbelly of her safe world. It’s riveting and complex
and forever relevant. Also: there are two worthy movie adaptations: The
Reckless Moment (1949) and The Deep End (2001 ).”
Forty Words For Sorrow by Giles Blunt
Indigenous people may or may not have 40 words for snow. But it does
inspire a great line in this bleak novel that launched a series. When
Canadi an detective John Cardinal is yet again the bearer of bad news, he
thinks, “What people really need is 40 words for sorrow.” A few years
before Louise Penny staked out Quebec with Inspector Gamache, Blunt
placed his protagonist in a fictional town in Ontario. Ignored by higher-ups
and even suspected of taking bribes, Cardinal fights to have the puzzle of
a missing Chippewa girl taken seriously and not dismissed as just another
runaway . Righteous anger and a search for justice are key reasons the
thriller genre is richer and better than ever.
The Hunter  by Donald Westlake (writing as Richard Stark)
Did Westlake have a split personality? Under his own name, Westlake often
delivered comic capers of the highest craft. And while he employed
nume rous pen names throughout his prolific career, Westlake saved the
lean, tough, really brutal stuff for books written by “Richard Stark.” Almost
all of those featured Parker, a vengeful criminal who really hates being
double-crossed. In fact, Westlake took a 20-year break from Parker novels
when that inner voice just didn’t show up. (Adapting a Jim Thompson novel
into the classic film The Grifters helped bring it back.) For author Daryl
Gregory (Revelator), the best thriller of all time is in fact the entire Parker
series. “Each book is a dose of the pure stuff,” says Gregory, “and I can’t
choose a favorite. This one is the first.” 
Kim by Rudyard Kipling
Kipling is often dismissed today as an apologist for the British Empire. His
work is far more complex and nuanced than that though and it would be a
shame to miss out on Kim, a key work in the history of the spy novel.
Against the backdrop of the Great Game (Britain and Russia striving to
dominate Central Asia), we have the story of an Irish orphan stranded in
India. Kim is immersed in the country’s dazzling diversity and becomes a
willing player for the Brits when his ability to pass for Indian himself proves
useful. While a reference to Kim’s “white” blood making him superior most
certainly reveals the aforementioned prejudice, the vast majority of the
novel is a love letter to India. It shows Kipling’s utmost respect for the
country’s religions, people, langua ges, culture and so much more, all while
revealing in fascinating detail Kim’s training as a spy. One of the great
entertainments.
11/22/63 by Stephen King
King outdoe s the The Day of The Jackal with this 2011 release. It’s possible
some readers in 1971 didn’t realize that world leader Charles de Gaulle was
alive and well and living in Paris when The Day of The Jackal came out
detailing an attempted assassination plot. But surely, in 2011, everyone in
America realized John. F. Kennedy was long dead. So, a time-traveling
novel about an attempt to stop Lee Harvey Oswald (and others, if that’s
your thing) should be completely lacking in tension, right? Nope! In recent
years, King has delivered one masterful novel after another in the crime-
thriller category, but suspense is his bread and butter. We might have
chosen Mr. Mercedes, the 2014 book which rightly won the Edgar Award
for Best Mystery Novel. But everything about 11/22/63 stands  out: King’s
attention to historic detail, the 800-plus pages that make sustaining the
tension all the more remarkable, and the painful truth that the past can’t be
fixed, only the future.
A Clean Kill In Tokyo (Rain Fall) by Barry Eisler
Assassins rank right up there with serial killers when it comes to jobs that
endlessly fascinate. And Eisler crafted a distinctive one right from the start
of his John Rain series. Rain is half-Japanese and half-American,
guaranteeing this loner will never quite fit in anywhere. Rain is also
haunte d by his military past, as is slowly revealed in this gripping novel.
Rain has a code (don’t all assassins?). And in his case, he won’t kill women
or children, he won’t work on a job also assigned to others and he won’t
kill anyone  to send a message. The target has to be the target, the
principal. Of course, rules only get you so far. After his latest assignment is
completed, Rain finds himself romantically involved with the dead man’s
daughter. Eisler passionately describes modern Tokyo, and you’re
completely sucked into a world and a series still going strong with
2021 ’s The Chaos Kind.
Get Carter (Jack’s Return Home) by Ted Lewis
Just stand aside when author David Peace (Tokyo Redux) gets on a roll
discussing this novel by Ted Lewis. “The 1971 film Get Carter, starring
Michael Caine and directed by Mike Hodges, is rightly hailed as one of the
greatest British films ever made,” says Peace. “But Jack’s Return Home, the
book on which it is based, and its author Ted Lewis, are both still not
cherished and celebrated enough. Because make no mistake: Jack’s
Return Home is the finest British crime novel ever written.” Crime fans
might know the story from the film version, but both the novel and the film
were like bathtub gin to critics and audiences at the time—too, too strong.
It played the drive-in circuit. And despite Caine’s stardom thanks to Alfie,
this story of an unrepentant gangster heading home to figure out who
offed the little brother he didn’t even really like just didn’t click. Indeed,
audiences embraced the Blaxploitation version made in 1972 more readily.
Over the years, the book and the film have steadily risen in popularity.
“Jack’s Return Home is where British Noir begins,” says Peace, “and the
one book every crime fan should read. And read again. And again.”
So Much Pretty by Cara Hoffman
A young woman has gone missing. Too many news stories begin that way.
But not many crime novels mine this fearful event for such a rich look at
the world we live in. The comparisons came fast and furious for Cara
Hoffman’s debut, including everything from Winter’s Bone (it’s set in a small
town in upstate New York) to The Lovely Bones (a missing girl novel
narrated by the missing girl herself, now in heaven) to The Girl With The
Dragon Tattoo (our protagonist is a journalist who moved to the town so
she could document the environmental damage caused by a local dairy).
Whatever the comparison, author Paula Hawkins (A Slow Fire Burning)
remains moved by it. “When I first read this novel, I lay awake at night
thinking about it,” Hawkins says. “Sometimes, almost a decade on, I still do,
because So Much Pretty is a deeply disturbing book. Hoffman tackles
misogyny, vengeance, rural poverty and familial love to devastating (and
unforgettable) effect.”
Rosemary’s Baby by Ira Levin
Levin delivered a string of hugely popular works, from the crime classic A
Kiss Before Dying and the iconic 1972 The Stepford Wives to the clone
thriller The Boys from Brazil and the Broadway  smash Deathtrap, a loving
spoof of mysteries. But author Robin Cook (Viral), then a young surgical
resident looking to catch some shut-eye, was forever changed by this
horror-suspense novel. “I happened upon an abandoned copy of
Rosemary’s Baby, and in a misguided idea that it might calm me down
enough to get some sleep, I started it,” Cook says. “Adhering to the cliché, I
couldn’t put it down. Not only did the experience make me into a thriller-
suspense fan, but I believe it also played a role in my becoming a thriller-
suspense writer myself.”
Out by Kirino Natsuo
Kirino’s been dubbed the Queen of Japanese Crime, and the happy truth is
that she’s at the vangua rd of a group of talented female authors in that
country. Most of her books haven’t been translated into English yet, but her
breakthrough work Out is a hit all around the world. A woman who toils
away at a bento factory comes home to an abusive husband who
announc es he’s lost all their money gambling. Then something snaps. She
strangles him to death and turns to three female coworkers for help in
disposing of the body. They gruesomely chop it up and bundle the parts
into various garbage bags secreted all over town. That’s when the trouble
starts. As a loan shark comes calling, the women begin blackmailing one
another and the cops get a little suspicious. It’s as fun and dark as it
sounds .
Road To Perdition by Max Allan Collins; art by Richard Piers
Rayner
Comic books and graphic novels practically revel in crime stories, from the
vigilantism of Batman  to the noir world of Sin City. But for fans of thrillers
and suspense who aren’t typically readers of comic books, perhaps the
best introduction is Road To Perdition. In it, an enforcer in organized crime
during the Great Depression is betrayed and must go on the lam with his
young son in tow. The attention to period detail and the way suspense can
mount without a single word being said are prime examples of the power
of comics. Perdition has spun off sequels, midquels (comics showing other
action while the original book took place), two prose sequels and a solid-
but-not-nearly-as-great movie starring Tom Hanks.
The F ourth Wall by Barbara Paul
 With so many women dominating the bestseller lists with great crime
novels, it’s no surprise they’re lifting up some of the less well-known
women who paved the way. That’s why author Charlaine Harris (The
Russian Cage) loves talking about this hidden gem, set in the world of
theater. In The Fourth Wall, someone is sabotaging a playwright’s newest
production by killing off key players. So the writer turns sleuth to solve the
crimes and save the day. After all, the show must go on. “This novel had a
huge impact on the way I wrote women,” Harris says. “Paul’s protagonist is
a playwright, a reader, a scholar—and an adult woman. The murders taking
place in the cast of her play offend her to the core. Every time I read The
Fourth Wall I’m deeply impressed.”
Tell No One by Harlan Coben
Coben was doing quite nicely. He had an ongoing series about Myron
Bolitar, a pro basketball player turned sports agent. His work was winning
awards. The future was laid out very nicely. And then, like a thunderbolt, he
got the idea: a killer hook for a stand-alone thriller. It became Tell No One,
the story of a husband anguished by the murder of his wife. Years later, he
receives a cryptic email suggesting she’s still alive, an email containing a
phrase only they shared and a warning to tell no one. It’s a page-turner of
the first order and the thriller that launched Coben into a name-brand
bestselling author. Reading this is a pleasure.
Malice Aforethought by Francis Iles
Well, there’s no mystery when we know the murderer right from the start!
But Malice Aforethought remains a classic crime novel, thanks to its
delicious irony. It begins with one of the most famous opening lines in
thrillerdom: “It was not until several weeks after he had decided to murder
his wife that Doctor Bickleigh took any active steps in the matter.” Will he
get away with it? Are we rooting for him? (His wife is awfully unpleasant.)
Isn’t that wrong? Everyone gets their just desserts, including the reader
who can feel the guilty pleasure of seeing the not-so-good doctor get
away with it. And yet, not.
Smilla’s Sense of Snow (Miss Smilla’s Feeling For Snow) by
Peter Høeg
Earlier Scandinavian thrillers occasionally broke through in the U.S., but
Smilla’s Sense of Snow was the Big Bang, the book that made Nordic Noir
a permanent part of the crime novel landscape. The movie didn’t do it
justice and we even got skittish over the enigmatic title. (Is Smilla’s Sense
of Snow an improvement or any clearer than Miss Smilla’s Feeling For
Snow? Not really.) Half Inuit and half Dutch, Smilla doesn’t really fit in
anywh ere. That outsider status makes her perfect for poking into the
seemingly accidental death of a child. With her enigmatic, strange and
satisfying story, Smilla opened up Denmark and its people to us and
opened up the rest of the world to the flood of great Nordic thrillers that
came in its wake.
The E ight by Katherine Neville
Neville’s best-selling debut has been compared to everything from
Alexandr e Dumas to Umberto Eco to Raiders Of The Lost Ark. And if that
starts your heart thumping with delight, you are in for a treat. Set in both
the 1970s and the 1790s, it involves an invaluable chess set once owned
by Charlemagne, mysterious powers, intrigue and enough conspiracies to
power a dozen Da Vinci Codes and National Treasures. Kathy Harig of
Mystery Loves Company bookstore simply calls it stunni ng. “This tour de
force of a thriller sets the bar for many modern quest novels to come. The
author’s breadth  of knowledge of history glows on every page.”
The E agle Has Landed by Jack Higgins
OK, a WWII thriller about German soldiers hoping to kidnap Winston
Churchill and spirit him to Nazi Germany is far-fetched. But Higgins (aka
Henry Patterson) details the plot so convincingly that the book became a
massive hit, selling more than 50 million copies and becoming one of the
bestselling books of all time. That’s a good trick. But the best trick is that
the unlikely protagonist is Liam Devlin, a fervent Irish Republican Army
member working in Berlin as a teacher of Gaelic. Even more surprising,
Devlin (played by Donald Sutherland in the film version) would be featured
in three more novels and then mentor IRA assassin Sean Dillon (who has
starred in 22 thrillers, right up to 2016’s The Midnight Bell).
The G ood Thi ef by Hannah Tinti
By law, we must refer to this debut novel by Tinti as “Dickensian.” Besides,
it’s that good: An early American spin on Oliver Twist set in New England
where an orphan boy with one hand is trained in the art of cons and
thievery. It’s delightfully filled with heroes and villains and a lad with a good
heart who yearns to find out who he is and what really happened to his
hand. Can you blame him? Tinti followed this up nine years later with a
marvelous modern noir about a father and daughter on the lam titled The
Twelve Lives of Samuel Hawley. So Tinti covers the waterfront from Robert
Louis Stevenson to Tarantino. We can’t wait to see what she delivers next.
IPCRESS File by Len Deighton
Deighton delivered a lot of great thrillers, and we were tempted to list his
1980s trilogy Berlin Game , Mexico Set and London Match. But nothing
equals the genius of his debut novel The IPCRESS File. Deighton came up
with the ultimate outsider in the world of British society: a working-class
bloke set amidst the toffs of British intelligence. Deighton based the idea
on his own experience being the only top person at an ad agency who
wasn’t educated at Eton. Embodied to perfection by Michael Caine in the
film version, the character dubbed Harry starred in a string of novels and
films to wonderful comic effect. James Bond he isn’t but Harry is a lot
funnier – and who can’t appreciate someone great at their job and
annoye d by bosses who are terrible at theirs?
Nineteen Seventy-Four by David Peace
Peace is praised to high-heaven by U.S. critics but hasn’t earned nearly the
high profile here that he’s gained in the U.K. His Tokyo Trilogy (detective
novels set during the U.S. occupation of Japan) should have put him over
the top. But any crime fan will relish the Red Riding Quartet, a string of
novels beginning with Nineteen Seventy-Four that are set against the
Yorkshire Ripper Murders. A very good miniseries starring Andrew Garfield
is available, but Peace’s riveting tale of police corruption and a serial killer
on the loose is too rich and satisfying to miss.
The Al ice Network by Kate Quinn
In World War I, the Alice Network was a real spy ring of women who kept
the Allied forces informed on troop movements and other vital information
in German-occupied France and Belgium. Quinn took this fascinating story
and merged it with the tale of a woman in 1947 searching for her cousin
who went missing during World War II. That doubles the suspense while
highlighting the challenges women always face in life and in war.  “This
historical thriller is a powerful story of personal redemption,” says Sarah
Young of The Raven bookstore. “I could not put it down.”
Related: Historical Fiction Books Author Kate Quinn is Loving 
Los Alamos by Joseph Kanon
A master of the historical thriller, Kanon has shone with thrillers like The
Good German (the film botched it completely!) and Istanbul Passage.
Approaching his tenth novel, Kanon had it all right from his award-winning
start with Los Alamos, which Barbara Peters of The Poisoned Pen
bookstore in Scottsdale, Ariz., calls an “intense, well-researched, intelligent
and slow-burn thriller” about the building of the first atomic bomb. “Think
of Alan Furst, Philip Kerr and the late John Le Carré,” she says.
Gorky Park by Martin Cruz Smith
Another massive bestseller, Gorky Park gave a glimpse into the crumbling
Soviet Union just as the Cold War reached its peak—and gave us a
sympathetic Russian hero while doing so. Author Mick Herron (Slough
House) returns to it again and again. “This remains for me the high-water
mark of the thriller,” says Herron, “a combination of classic tropes (honest
cop working within a corrupt system) and original setting (Soviet-era
Moscow). Many writers attempted to pull off similar tricks after this proved
such a hit, but few succeeded. Forty years on, after five or six readings,
Gorky Park still thrills. I expect it always will.”
The E xpats by Chris Pavone
The international thriller isn’t dead, it just got married—and that
complicates things immensely. Pavone’s debut combines the double life of
a spy with the sometimes cloak-and-dagger nature of marriage. You can’t
be honest about everything, can you? After a couple relocates from the
U.S. to the tax haven of Luxembourg, it all seems too good to be true. Of
course, it is, especially when new friends prove a little too intrusive. Our
hero worries her deep dark secret might spill out, but why exactly does her
husband seem to have a deep dark secret of his own? That’s her job.
Twisty and fun, Pavone’s novel excels at playing off the demands of work
and home, even when work is, you know, top secret.
The C ollector by John Fowles
Before Fowles won over hippies with The Magus and then wowed the
world with The French Lieutenant’s Woman, he penned a shockingly
intimate look at a psychotic young man who kidnaps the woman of his
obsessions and locks her in his cellar. Disturbing and empathetic, it splits
essentially in two, with half the novel told from the point of view of the
“collector” and the other half from the woman he’s holding against her will.
Creepy and cool, it’s as hard to shake as the stalker himself.
Winter Counts by David Heska Wanbli Weiden
Nothing invigorates the crime genre quite like a fresh setting, a fresh pair
of eyes and fresh difficulties we haven’t seen protagonists deal with
before. That’s what makes this debut so exciting. Weiden is an enrolled
citizen of the Sicangu Lakota nation and his creation Virgil Wounded Horse
is a familiar figure with new complexities. Half Lakota, half white, the man is
an enforcer—the muscle you call in when the U.S. legal system or the tribal
council fail you or don’t even try. But life on the Rosebud Indian
Reservation in South Dakota gets complicated when heroin comes pouring
in and the nephew Virgil is raising starts drowning in it. Pairing up with the
ex-girlfriend he still loves, fighting his own addiction to alcohol and
navigating a minefield of some tribal leaders with their own agenda, Virgil
not only needs to find and stop the drug dealers, he needs to find himself,
too.
The Human Fac tor by Graham Greene
The famous  espionage novels by Greene roll off the tongue  easily: The
Quiet American, The Confidential Agent, the screenplay and novel for The
Third Man to name  a few. But author Giles Blunt (Vanishing Act) puts his
money down on 1978’s The Human Factor, in which a mid-level bureaucrat
in MI6 works for his country but also feels a duty to the Communists who
helped his wife escape apartheid South Africa. “It’s free of his Catholic-
convert angst and, like the best of le Carré, brings the big picture of
international espionage home to the bland ‘little’ people pushing paper in
the office,” says Blunt. As a spy novel free of violence, it’s a rebuke both to
gun-toting secret agents and the West’s cynical attitude toward South
Africa.
Before I Go To Sleep by S.J. Watson
Watson put his own clever spin on memory loss with this story of a woman
whose mind is erased every morning. She wakes up not recognizing the
man beside her or even her own face and must slowly piece together the
facts: she’s 47 and many years ago an accident left her with this terrible
burden of forgetting. But wait, some things her loving husband tells her
simply don’t add up. And they don’t quite gibe with the diary she struggles
to keep. And why would her therapy sessions be kept a secret from him?
Ingenious twists made this 2011 update on gaslighting an out-of-the-box hit
that turned Watson into a name-brand author from the start, if we
remember correctly.
Miami Blues by Charles Willeford
Is it cruel or pretty awesome that Willeford lived just long enough to see
his work gain long overdue success? He’d been delivering oddball crime
novels since the 1950s, and while other writers noticed, readers weren’t
exactly clamor ing for the latest Willeford. Author Padgett Powell (Indigo)
appreciates the balance Willeford struck: “These books featured heroes
that Willeford seemed to want to position just this side of the indecency
fence—the likable unlikeable fellow,” Powell says. “It was a delicate titration
reminiscent somewhat of Bukowski and his you-want-to-love-them drunks.
But Willeford has a larger range. The whole nasty Western world is in view,
not just the bottle.” Like so many crime writers before him, Willeford struck
paydirt when he launched the Hoke Moseley series in 1984. In Miami
Blues, our hangdog hero faces the indignity of a killer who knocks him out
and steals not just Moseley’s gun and badge but even his dentures(!). Out
of nowhere, Willeford was hot. Three more books followed along with
actual reviews, publicity, movie deals and the biggest payday of his career.
Then he died of a heart attack in March 1988 just days after his final book
hit the stores. At least he might have died smiling.
The K ill Artist by Daniel Silva
One of the pleasures of the thriller genre is the chance for an ongoing
series that maintains a high quality without spinning its wheels. Since he
began the Gabr iel Allon novels in 2000, Silva has not disappointed. His
hero is an assassin and spy for the Office (aka Mossad), using work as an
art restorer for cover. Silva is an adult convert to Judaism and his character
is in a way new to the religion as well, having been raised in a secular
household. The novels are steeped in the Middle East (where Silva worked
as a journalist) but also outside current events, giving them a timeless
quality. Haunte d by a terrorist attack that killed his son and drove his wife
mad, Allon is a tortured man whose gift for killing is the polar opposite of
his ability to bring artwork back to life.
The Ho t Kid by Elmore Leonard
We began with Ian Fleming because most people have fantasized—even if
just for a moment—about being a James Bond-level secret agent. And we
end with Leonard because every writer on this list has probably fantasized
—even if just for a moment—about being Leonard. Masterful at dialogue,
great at plotting, overflowing with memorable characters, funny , tense,
endur ing—the fiction of this master has it all. And no matter which one you
pick, someone is going to mention another. What about Get Shorty? Or Out
Of Sight? Rum Punch? Or the Westerns? What about the Westerns? We’re
choosing 2005 ’s The Hot Kid just to remind everyone that Leonard didn’t
miss a step even toward the end of his career. Set during the Depression, it
follows the wunde rkind lawman Carl Webster as he deals with a persistent
criminal determined not to pull off the big job for his own sake but just so
he can become public enemy number one. Hey, it’s good to have goals.
The Hot Kid is funny , violent, insightful about myth-making and spot-on in
its period detail. Like so much of Leonard’s work, it just doesn’t get any
better than this.
