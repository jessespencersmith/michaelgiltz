8/18/2004 01:02:00 PMDonald Rumsfeld is the latest Bush administration official to hedgevery strongly on central elements of the 9/11 commission'srecommendations. Since Bush has supported a weakened, almostuseless head of intelligence with no budgetary power and thereforeno real authority, Rummy supports that too. But he says we shouldbe very wary of even half-implementing other recommendations andopposes having paramilitary operations move from the CIA to thePentagon.Okay, the changes in our gov't structure are sweeping andfar-reaching. And the 9/11 commission is not God and we don't haveto accept its recommendations as the Ten Commandments.But don't let Bush play it both ways. He wants to pretend he supportsits results and wants to implement its recommendations all whileopposing the substance of most of the major changes.Bush opposed the 9/11 commission being formed, against the wishesof the victims' families.Bush dragged his feet repeatedly, refusing to cooperate for months ata time.Bush tried to insist the 9/11 commission wrap up its work early eventhough it had been so slow in responding to requests for info that thecommission would have been unable to do its job properly.Bush administration officials balked at appearing before the 9/11commission. Bush himself was too afraid to appear in front of themon his own.Bush pretended to embrace the final report but has clearly andconsistently fought against all the major recommendations itproposed. Bush administration officials have come out in opppositionto many of those changes. Bush himself wants to castrate the centralidea of creating a head of intelligence that has real authority.And it goes on. So every time Bush tries to say he supports thecommission and its findings, the media must and should say, "You'rekidding, right?"
