8/12/2004 09:03:00 AMYep, John Kerry pulls ahead of Bush in the latest Florida poll. But whydoes this AP story characterize a swing from a dead-heat at 43%each to 47% for Kerry and 41% for Bush as a "slight" lead? Thatlooks like a significant change to me. Another thing, why isn't thismore prominent on the NYT website? I'd call this breaking news moreimportant than a piece on Giuliani being Bush's attack dog, an updateon the Kobe Bryant case and other stuff placed higher.
