8/22/2004 10:01:00 PMA front page story in the Sunday New York Times details the plans byBush aides for the Republican National Convention in NYC. Top ontheir list? Lying."Mr. Bush's advisers said they were girding for the most extensivestreet demonstrations at any political convention since the Democratsnominated Hubert H. Humphrey in Chicago in 1968. But in contrast tothat convention, which was severely undermined by televised displaysof street rioting, Republicans said they would seek to turn anydisruptions to their advantage, by portraying protests by evenindependent activists as Democratic-sanctioned displays of disrespectfor a sitting president."Note the words I've italed. Bush aides happily admit they are going toLIE and claim that American citizens they know to be independent areworking with the Democrats. And the Times doesn't even blink.ADDED NOTE FROM JOHN: ONE MONTH AGO I reported thatRepublican sources said the GOP was planning to use protesters atthe GOP convention to tar the Dems, they had already rented TVtrucks to beam photos of the most outrageous protesters to Christianbroadcasting networks, etc.
