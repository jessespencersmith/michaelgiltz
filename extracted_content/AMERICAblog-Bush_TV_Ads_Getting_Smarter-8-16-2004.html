8/16/2004 09:44:00 PMUSA Today details two new ads unveiled by the Bush campaign thatare effective and smart. The less damning one ties in to the Olympicsby saying "this Olympics...there will be two more free nations." Thathighlights the one unquestionable good of those twin invasions -- thepossible self-rule of Afghanistan and Iraq after suffering years ofhorrible dictatorships. Afghanistan features its first female athletesand the Iraqi socceer team is enjoying an unexpected string ofvictories.The one targeted directly at Kerry scores a direct hit; Kerry's teamhas done a poor job of responding."It charges that when he was a member of the Senate IntelligenceCommittee in the mid-1990s, Kerry missed most of the panel's openhearings...."The weak response from Kerry's team was that this was based onlyon the 65 open meetings and didn't include attendance for the morethan 329 closed hearings. But the committee's Republican chairmanSen. Pat Roberts of Kansas immediately called on Kerry to let himrelease those attendance records as well. Kerry's people didn't offerattendance figures for the hearings that aren't public record, so wecan only assume they aren't good either.They need to come up with a better response -- how does hisattendance compare to other members at the time or some suchreasoning -- or Bush will wisely bring this up again and again.
