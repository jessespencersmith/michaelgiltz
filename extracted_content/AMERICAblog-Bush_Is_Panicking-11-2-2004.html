11/02/2004 09:39:00 PMIn a huge, highly unusual step, Bush is inviting reporters into theWhite House to talk to the nation before the votes have beencounted. ABC is speculating that Bush will be urging voters to go tothe polls and say he is still fighting and so should they. (A number ofbattleground states have late poll closings, like 10 p.m. EST and ofcourse then there's Hawaii.)Really big break with tradition and certainly NOT a sign of confidence.ABC's Terry Moran describes the Bush people as "highly combative"and Dean Reynolds describes the Kerry camp as confident and veryoptimistic about Ohio and Pennsylvania and Florida.Bush is panicking!Now Peter Jennings is grilling RNC head Ed Gillespie and finding outEd has no idea what Bush is going to say and hasn't spoken to him ina while. Fascinating.Bush is panicking!HISTORICAL UPDATE: As ABC points out, Bush called in the mediawhen Florida was called for Gore (how could it go to Gore? Hisbrother had PROMISED him!) and said he didn't believe it andquestioned the numbers. That of course was the beginning of hisstrategy of acting like the victor even when he clearly lost the popularvote. Bush didn't want anyone in the western states to think it wasover. Hmmmm. Don't let the loser behave like a winner.FINAL UPDATE: Truly bizarre. Bush seemed to just want the camerasto show him looking calm and smiling. Hey buddy, if you were calmand smiling, why would we need to see you looking calm and smiling?
