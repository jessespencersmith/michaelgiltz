            <p>S U N D AY,  A U G U S T  2 7 ,  2 0 0 6The Emmys: Who To Root AGAINSTEveryone making Emmy predictions tells you who they would root forand who they think will win. Not me. Half the fun of awards shows isrooting AGAINST a certain nominee. For example, at the 2004Grammys, I really loved Green Day's "American Idiot," liked AliciaKeys' "The Diary of Alicia Keys" and didn't mind Kanye West's "CollegeDropout." And Usher's "Confessions" was catchy as hell -- just plainirresistible. So I was rooting for Green Day but I was rooting AGAINSTRay Charles even more strongly. Of course I love Brother Ray, but thetepid "Genius Loves Company" (jammed full of tired celebrity duets) isa terrible introduction to such a titanic talent. And the mere fact that hedied meant this unworthy final CD could become many people's first(and last) album of his they buy. That would be a disaster, so I rootedagainst it...and watched it win Album of the Year. At this year's Oscars,I loved "Capote" and "Good Night and Good Luck." But my heartbelonged to "Brokeback Mountain," which would be an overduetriumph for Ang Lee. And even Steven Spielberg's "Munich" wouldhave been such an oddball choice, I could have enjoyed it. But "Crash"was virtually my LEAST favorite movie of the year, an empty-headedWest Coast look at racism that was about as insightful as an episode of"Diff'rent Strokes" (and not nearly as funny). Lord, how I wanted thatmovie to lose. Naturally, it won. I could give many other examples (notall of them thwarted desires), but the point is clear: sometimes ourgreatest passion is poured into rooting against a nominee. So here ismy Emmy rundown, highlighting the one choice I would HATE to seetriumph on Emmy night and why.AND THE WINNER HOPEFULLY ISN'T...BEST DRAMA -- please not..."The West Wing." A worthy show at first,though winning four years in a row also reflected Emmy's worsttendencies of repeated knee-jerk nominations and wins. Sure, itregained a little momentum for its last hurrah, but it and "TheSopranos" should not have been nominated this year. Please nosentimental parting gift.BEST COMEDY -- please not..."Two and a Half Men." A perfectlyserviceable show and I like both Jon Cryer and Charlie Sheen.
