<p>NON-FICTION  
It’s the Final Countdown
The Black Comedy of ‘Midnight In Chernobyl’
 February 18, 2019  Michael Giltz
I kept laughing out loud while reading this marvelous, remarkably-detailed look at the Chernobyl nuclear
meltdown. That made it a little awkward when someone asked, “What are you reading?” and I had to say “anonfiction book about the worst nuclear disaster in history (so far).” I wasn’t ha-ha laughing. It was a bleak,“Dr. Strangelove”  sort of laugh. I couldn’t do anything else in face of the idiocy and incompetence and sheer,
frightening, dear-god-did-they-really detail I found on every page of Adam Higginbotham’s book Midnight InChernobyl .
The tragedy begins with the very design of the nuclear reactors built at Chernobyl and throughout the SovietUnion. People knew they were deeply flawed. But that totalitarian state didn’t like admitting error.  Disastrous
accidents  happened throughout the USSR, but they deemed each one a state secret. The state didn’t even tell
 the nuclear scientists and engineers at other power plants about them. And they certainly didn’t learn from theaccidents,improve designs, or share what they learned with others. They made roofs of asbestos when othermaterial wasn’t available. They used subpar building material. And on and on and on.
Thanks to the fall of that empire, and a mountain of declassified documents, Higginbotham gives a blow-by-
blow account of the tragedy. He recounts the shame and bravery of those involved (sometimes the shame andthen bravery of the same person). Then he continues the story through the cover-up and the blowback fromMikhail Gorbachev’s attempt at perestroika. Most importantly, he details the ongoing environmental andpersonal disaster impacting the earth and the people involved.</p>
<p>← The Eyes Don’t Have It Ready for a Post-Roe America →Higginbotham captures the voices and personalities of so many vivid characters, from high-ranking Party
officials to the first responder who was luckily drunk the night he responded to the fire at the plant. This gainedhim some all-important protection from radiation.
Most memorably, he profiles Maria Protsenko, a diminutive architect, formidable, talented and no-nonsense. She
was born in China to Sino-Russian parents and probably had two strikes against her from the start in the USSR.Her grandfather disappeared during a Stalinist purge. Two siblings died unnecessarily because of a curfew thatkept her family from taking them to a doctor. Her father descended into opium addiction. And still  Protsenko
became a model Communist.
She planned the city where workers at Chernobyl lived. During the sudden evacuation, she proved a model of
efficiency. Then she worked with soldiers trying to deal with the crisis and ultimately wall off the devastatedarea. Towards the end of the book, the author interviews her. When he can’t discern the smell of a book shebrought out of Cherbobyl, Protsenko puckishly blows dust from it into his face. When he’s understandablyhorrified, she laughs off his concern. Who couldn’t love her?
Whether you read it for the drama, for the careful and fascinating science around this tragedy, as a warning for
the future or simply as a horror story to share with unsuspecting brunch companions, Midnight In Chernobyl isfirst-rate, funny and ultimately so very, very sad.
