haunting theme song ("Calling

Morris virtually vindicates the 
man through some astonishing

contained some of the best dialogue of the year, and it 
is delivered with zest by Susan Sarandon and especially 
Kevin Costner, who simply inhabits the screen as an 
over-the-hill baseball player called in to mentor a young 
hotshot on his way to the majors. Iv' ~rIa f'Ol«k--llIiti. ;aJte
