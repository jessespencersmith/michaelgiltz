            <p>T U E S D AY,  F E B R U A RY  1 3 ,  2 0 0 7Cruise and Stiller As The Hardy Boys Turned MenI kind of liked "Starsky & Hutch" and there's no reason to diss a moviethat doesn't even have a script yet. But in fact that's exactly WHY Idon't feel good about this high concept pairing of Tom Cruise and BenStiller as the Hardy Boys all grown up and not speaking to each otherbut forced to work together to solve a new mystery. Right now, it's justa dumb idea going out to writers. If there was a finished script thatactually gave this one-liner idea a clever, smart spin that won themover, I might be more enthusiastic. But it's just a not-very-inspiringidea that kind of sounds commercial. With this summer's lame looking"Nancy Drew" movie coming, it's not a good time for teen sleuths. I'llstick with the Mickey Mouse Club serial of The Hardy Boys that justcame out on DVD and which I've been enjoying.NOTE: Popsurfer Ed Sikov's commment was too funny to leave in thenotes section. he wrote: "They should combine the two franchises andmake a Nancy Boys mystery. I'd pay to see that." Genius.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
