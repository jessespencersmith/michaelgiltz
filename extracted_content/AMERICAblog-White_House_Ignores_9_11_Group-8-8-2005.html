8/08/2005 06:44:00 PMBush hated the 9-11 Commission, argued against forming it inthe first place, hated the idea of Homeland Security, foughtagainst providing info to it every step of the way, foughtagainst having any of his top officials testify, fought againsthaving to testify himself and was too scared to testify withouthaving Cheney sit next to him and hold his hand, and gavelip-service to its recommendations only because it was sopopular. Really, why should Bush be interested in finding outhow the worst intelligence failure in our nation's historyhappened on his watch in hopes of preventing it fromhappening again?Now that the 9-11 group wants to do a follow-up, they have noofficial standing, so Bush can tell them to take a hike.Thomas H. Kean, the former Republican governor of NewJersey who led the bipartisan Sept. 11 commission, said hewas surprised and disappointed that the White House, thePentagon, the State Department, the Central IntelligenceAgency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and severalother executive branch agencies had failed to respond torequests made two months ago for updated information onthe government's antiterrorism programs."It's very disappointing," Mr. Kean said of theadministration's failure to cooperate with the group. "Allwe're trying to do is make the public safer."Mr. Kean said there had been no response of any sortto interview requests for Defense Secretary Donald H.Rumsfeld; Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice; Porter J.Goss, the C.I.A. director; Robert S. Mueller III, the F.B.I.director, and Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief ofstaff, among others.That's right. Bush can't even be bothered to say a polite "no." He'sjust closing his eyes and ears and pretending they don't even exist.
