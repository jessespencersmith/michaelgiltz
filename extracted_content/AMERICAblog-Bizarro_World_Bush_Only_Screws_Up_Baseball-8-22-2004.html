8/22/2004 10:29:00 PMIn a Friday NYT column about the reign of Bud Selig (a disastrousCommissioner of baseball that columnist Murray Chass extols as oneof the best), there's a quick peek into what might have been forGeorge Bush.A failure at oil drilling, a failure at running the Texas Rangers, Bushwas sittin' around looking for something to do."No wonder George W. Bush never got an answer when, as managingpartner of the Texas Rangers, he told Selig he was willing to becomecommissioner if the owners wanted him. Bush kept waiting andasking, but the acting commissioner [Selig] gave no answer."Eventually Bush had to make a decision because the TexasRepublican Party was pressuring him to run for governor, and hedecided he could wait no longer for a reply from Selig."He opted for politics over baseball, and that's why today he isrunning for re-election as president of the United States."Being commissioner of baseball probably sounded like a lot more funand a lot less taxing than being President. And, my God, if Bud Selighad relented, Bush might have only screwed up baseball instead ofthe entire country! It hurts to even think about this for more than aminute, so don't try.
