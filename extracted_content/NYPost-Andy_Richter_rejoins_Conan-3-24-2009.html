OR Andy Richter - the
once and future sidekick of
Conan O'Brien - saying
yes to rejoining O'Brien when
the talk show host takes over
the "Tonight" show this fune
was almost entirely positive.
"The only down side was I
felt like I might havE to eat
soine crow from some of the
more snarky members of the
entertainment press," admits
the 42-year-old actor and co-
median. ':But then I thought,
'Crow cari be prepared in very
delicious ways. Crow burrito.
I love burritos!"'
Though Richter said good-
bye to late night nine years
ago, he's returned often (in-
cluding as a guest on O'Bri-
en's final show) and been
working steadily with every-
thing from voice-work in the
"Madagascar" movies tg sit-
coms like "Andy Barker,
P.I." (overseen by O'Brien)
and "Andy Richter Gontrols
Ihe Universe," both of
which came and went quickly.
For Richter, Conan's offer
couldn't have come at a better
time.
"I really do feel like - espe-
cially in the last couple of
years - that I've been stand-
ing in a storm and someone
opened a door and said, 'Get
out of the rain. Come in here
with us,"' says Richter. If
Conan hesitated in asking, it
wasn't for lack of desire.
"I guess Conan said,'God, I
wish,A,ndy would do it. Do
you think he would do it? He
probably wouldn't come
back,"'says Richter.
"I guess he bugged every-Andy Richter (left) will rcioln Gonan 0'Brien when he moves into the "Tonight" spot this summer.
Richter: Reunion came just in time
body and kept going over it
for a couple of months. And,
finally, feff Ross the [execu-
tiveJ producer just got sick of
him and said,'Why don't you
call him?"'
"And that's what he did.
That night he called me at
home, and we talked for anhour. And I knew what she
was going to say, but I said
'Let me talk to my wife.'
"I'm just so thrilled to be
working with friends and get-
ting out ofhaving to sit across
the table from idiots," he
laughs.
"The only person I reallyfeel like I,Bot to worry about
talking about whether or not
something's funny is Conan
O'Brien and I can't think of
anybody better to have that
conversation with.
"He's done a wonderful
thing giving me this opportu-
nity."</p>
