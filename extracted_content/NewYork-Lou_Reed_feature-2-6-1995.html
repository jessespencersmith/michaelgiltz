Andy Wamol, as his current retrospective at Film 
Forum reminds us, loved to watch. Anything. His 
1964 movie Empire was a continuous static shot of 
the Empire State Building, and The Velvet Underground and 
Nico (1966) was a 67 ·minute recording of the group rehears­
ing one song, "Melody Laughter," until the cops barged in to 
make them tum down the amps. "I think they thought we 
were the center of some huge drug ring," jokes VU frontman 
Lou Reed, whose band's wildly 
influential muHimedia stage 
shows were orchestrated by 
Wamol. The aforementioned 
rehearsal was probably for a 
performance at the Film-Mak­
ers' Cinematheque in Febru­
ary 1966. Wamol had a week 
to fill, remembers Reed, "and 
he'd seen us play, and he said, 
'Oh, oh, ohhhh. I don't know 
what I'm going to do. I have a 
week there. Why don't I show 
the movies on you?' And he 
did •••• He was a giant. H was 
the greatest fun being around him. He was so smart. Very, 
very funny. I really miss him." 
Oddly, given all of Wamol's involvement, says Reed, "he 
never filmed the show itself, which is-amazing. He taped 
everything else, but not that. And there's not a club that I've 
been to that doesn't show the influence of them: the light 
shows, wearing all black ••• usually you'll even see our little 
mirror ball." Some of Wamol's innovations, however, didn't 
stand the test of time quite as well. "He would often have 
people in the audience work the light machines," says Reed, 
"which was an expensive thing to do because people would 
drop them." MICHAEl GILlZ</p>
