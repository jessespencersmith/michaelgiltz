9/02/2005 12:08:00 AMSome choice highlights.Koppel (on the number of people at the convention center --the mayor says 15,000 to 25,000 and FEMA said only 5000):One of you is wrong. It's either 5000 or 15,000. Do you know?Brown of FEMA: Blah blah blah. 25,000.... We just learned ofthe convention center -- we being the federal government --today.Koppel: I've heard you say during the course of a number ofinterviews that you found out about the convention centertoday. Don't you guys watch television? Don't you guyslisten to the radio? Our reporters have been reporting on itfor more than just today.Brown of FEMA: We learned about (the convention center)FACTUALLY today that that's what existed.(Brown responds to another question by saying troops aregoing to be moving in soon.)Koppel: Here we are essentially FIVE DAYS after the storm hitand you're talking about what's going to happen in the nextcouple of days.... You didn't make preparations for what wasgoing to happen in the event that [a category four storm hit].Why didn't you?(Brown then complains that poor people who don't own carsand can't afford hotel rooms didn't jump into their SUVs andhead to the Hyatt in Atlanta. He then sidesteps Koppel byimplying it was the city's fault for not having buses availablefor the very poor.)Koppel: I'm not asking you why the city didn't have busesavailable. I'm asking you why you didn't have National Guardswith trucks to get them out of there. Why you didn't havepeople with flatbed trailers if that's what you needed. Why youdidn't simply get as many Greyhound buses from surroundingstates as you could lay your hands on to get those people outof there. Why you haven't done it TO THIS DAY.Transcript and video coming soon.Thank God Koppel is there to ask the common sense questionswe've been talking about all day. And how soon before Browngets his Medal of Freedom?NOTE: One quote caught my ear but I didn't quite focus on it.I've played it again and Brown is laying the groundwork forputting the blame on LA's governor. (It must be a Fox Newstalking point; my dad made the same argument earlier.)Brown of FEMA: We work closely with the state government.The federal government didn not just come in here and tell thestate governor how or what to do. We came in here and said,'What do you want us to do? We will help you.' We are now
