 CDs: Willie Nelson's New
American Classic

Some of my favorite albums of all time were
recorded by artists well past their "prime"
because great singers continue to learn and grow.
Frank Sinatra had a voice so creamy and pure he
was known simply as The Voice in his youth. But
he was a better singer in the Capitol years whenSinatra's voice deepened and gained a swaggeringconfidence. That was the sweet spot of his career:
the period when he had the most vocal elasticity
AND a growing understanding of how to sing.
And yet, I love to hear late period Sinatra on Reprise. His voice was a shadow of its former self, but
Sinatra knew so much more about the lyrics he was singing and how to sing them that the
shortened breath, the loss of range, the age in his voice simply added to the beauty of his singing.When he sang "Send in the Clowns, " a song I had no interest in hearing anyone sing, frankly, andhe snapped off the line, "Isn't it RICH?" it had more power and emotion than all the vocal
pyrotechnics of Celine Dion and Mariah Carey ( and even Charisse ) combined. Peggy Lee's  Miss
Peggy Sings The Blues.  Muddy Waters' Hard Again . Roy Orbison's triumphant  live concert Black
and White  are just a few other examples of this phenomenon.
And now, Willie Nelson's American Classic  can be added to the list. This is being touted as the
first official follow-up to Stardust , the landmark Willie Nelson album  that stayed on the country
charts literally forever, just like Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon  took up permanent residence
on the pop charts. It's not true, of course. Nelson has recorded a number of albums containing
standards, such as What A Wonderful World and Over The Rainbow . And if you broaden the
meaning of a standard, just last year he delivered one of the best albums of his career, a de factotribute to Louis Armstrong with Wynton Marsalis called Two Men With The Blues.  (In fact, I
named it the best album of 2008.)
But who cares? American Classic  is clearly an intentional, formal sequel to Stardust  and it
succeeds beautifully. It's easy to forget how strange Stardust  was when it came out. The
arrangements sounded loose, even awkward. Nelson rambled through songs like "Blue Skies" and
"Don't Get Around Much Anymore" and it was over almost before it began. But that was the first

<p>listen. When you lived with it for a while, the mellow mood, Willie's seemingly casual vocals and
the low-key backing coalesced into perfection. Suddenly, every note seemed exactly where it
needed to be. Every vocal inflection carried a wealth of meaning. And the album as a whole
revealed itself as a classic. No wonder it was an immediate success, hitting #1 on the Country
charts and earning Nelson a Grammy for his vocals on "Georgia On My Mind." Now Rolling Stone
ranks Stardust  as one of the 500 Best Albums Of All Time  and it's sold more than 5 million copies.
But at the time, his record label thought Nelson had lost his mind.
Of course, Blue Note is a lot more comfortable with albums of standards. And Willie Nelson has
become an American classic himself, beloved by all even as he travels around on his bus, seeminglyshowered with marijuana by fans, extolling the virtues of alternative fuel and singing and recording
with his usual alacrity. In 1978, Nelson released three albums including Stardust . In 2009 he's
releasing at least three albums -- the OK Naked Willie,  the solid Willie and the Wheel (a
collaboration with Asleep At The Wheel), American Classic  -- and a DVD of his Lincoln Center
concert with Wynton Marsalis  that was a tribute to Ray Charles.
His voice is cracked and quiet now. Nelson always had a conversational style of singing, adeceptively simple approach that masked his playful sense of the beat and his insightful way with
lyrics. But his craggy, lean style is as much a nod to age as it is a choice. He simply can't sing the
way he could 30 years ago. But he doesn't need to anymore. Because Nelson is a better, savvier
singer now. Yes, Nelson brings a wealth of good feeling and love to any song he sings: you can'thelp but smile when you hear his voice. But even if you'd never heard him before, you could put onone of his best albums and it would stop you in your tracks. He's not just beloved and we're notjust giving him applause for past accomplishments. He's good .
American Classic  begins with an atypical number. "The Nearness Of You" is the longest song on
the album and contains the fullest string arrangement. It's like a formal introduction, with Nelsonwalking out in a tuxedo and showing he can play it straight just like anyone else.
It's followed by the shortest song on the album, "Fly Me To The Moon," which was swung to the
limit by Frank Sinatra with Count Basie and is an a cappella showcase for Tony Bennett. Theelectric organ and keyboards immediately set a jaunty, far more casual tone that will be maintained
throughout the CD. Nelson has already unloosened his bow-tie and unbuttoned his shirt. The
loping tone suits his singing, which is quiet and fragile and the music ends almost abruptly in away that catches you short. The accompaniment throughout will be sensitive and telling, as thisshows.
Next is "Come Rain Or Come Shine," which starts with a gospel-tinged piano intro. Often it's
performed as a defiant, just-try-and-stop-me declaration of love (such as Dinah Washington's
marvelous take on her essential Dinah Jams ). But here Nelson is confident and matter-of-fact.
"You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me" he says simply and you don't doubt it for a moment.
"If I Had You" is the first of two duets, this one featuring Diana Krall. (She's having a great year,
too, thanks to one of her best CDs -- Quiet Nights  -- as well as overseeing Barbra Streisand's new
album.) Krall's smoky, relaxed approach to singing fits perfectly with Nelson and they trade lines
seamlessly. As he's done throughout his career, Nelson plays with the melody -- rushing in before
the beginning of some lines in a rush of words, teasing them out on others. Their styles might betoo similar to do an entire album, actually, but for one number it works perfectly.
"Ain't Misbehavin" is next. And here again, the musical accompaniment is key. It's a playful silly
song -- at least that's how it's usually performed. But after a casual beginning, the tune grows
insistent. "Like Jack Horner/ in the corner/ don't go nowhere/ what do I care/ your kisses are
worth waiting for" becomes bold and beautiful, coming hard on the heels of an excellent keyboardsolo that reveals the emotion churning just below the surface.
It's hard to talk about Nelson's singing without hearing it. On "I Miss You So," the way his voice
wavers on "after glow" can warm you. On "Because Of You" he throws off the opening phrase
almost before the song seems to start, mirroring the way everything is shadowed by the object of
his affection. The heartfelt "Since I Fell For You" also contains vulnerability: listen to the way "lovebrings such misery and pain" is echoed by the descending harmonica solo. And the sheer bliss of
Nelson strolling through "On The Street Where You Live" accompanied by marvelous guitar and
piano is accomplished with a vocal that barely rises above a conversational whisper. (The video canbe found on the Amazon page selling the album .)
Initially, "Baby, It's Cold Outside" was my least favorite track, even though it's a duet with NorahJones. It just seemed too obvious a choice for a duet. Then I remembered Joni Mitchell's tart

Thin?response when someone described her brilliant tune "River" as being used way too often on holiday
CDs that wanted to be cool. Mitchell said -- quite rightly -- that a song that was so good that
everyone wanted to be recorded USED to be called a standard and that was supposed to be a good
thing. Indeed. And after a few plays, their interplay didn't just remind me of the zillion otherrenditions of that song but took on its own sweet character.
"Angel Eyes" is the closest to the opening track, with its elaborate string arrangement at the
beginning. But some more harmonica brings it back down to earth, just in time for Nelson to give a
master class in understatement. "Try to think that love's not around/ but it's uncomfortably near"
is the first line and the way he allows his voice to crack while reaching for the high note on"uncomfortably" (and later on "unbearably" and "uncommonly") is exactly the sort of stroke onlyan artist with a lifetime of experience can deliver.
It ends with a new rendition of one of the many songs Nelson has made famous on his own:
"Always On My Mind." Stripped of the choral background singers and declaimed by Nelson inmasterful manner, he sings, "Maybe I didn't love you, quite as often as I could have" and the line
descends gently into the regret of lower notes and suddenly the song is fresh and new again.
Almost none of this struck me on my first listen. But I've lived with this album for weeks and it's
grown inestimably in my eyes during that time, just as Stardust  did all those many years.
But you don't need to take my word for it. You can stream virtually the entire album on Nelson's
MySpace page.  Play it a few times over a few days or weeks and you'll want your own copy soon
enough.
I'd love to talk to Nelson about how he approaches singing these songs. Does he just run through
them a few times and then record them, letting his natural gift for phrasing and playing with the
beat take over? Does he let the arrangements guide him? Does he study the lyrics? He's recorded
so many albums over so many years, Nelson may not always realize he's hit one out of the parkuntil others point it out. I imagine last year's Two Men With The Blues was just a fun night at
Lincoln Center until the acclaim started rolling in. But sometimes you know. And that's why this
CD is called American Classic.
