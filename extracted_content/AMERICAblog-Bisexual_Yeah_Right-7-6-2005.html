7/06/2005 02:45:00 AMOK, I avoided this article at first because it seemed toextrapolate a great deal from one poorly done study --something the media specializes in. As you know, the NYTreported on a study that claims to show most men who saythey are bisexual are in fact basically attracted to one sex --namely men. So those bis are liars.My problems with the study: they recruited 101 young men --33 of whom said they were bi, 30 straight, and 30 homosexual.First of all, why young men? The researchers seem to beconfusing young men who haven't fully come out yet withbisexuals. It's commonly understood that some young menfirst feel comfortable saying they're bi before finally admittingthey're gay. Other young men presumably self-identify with"bi" because it's cool and rebellious.They might have easily eliminated these by casting a wider net,using older people or at least using bisexual people who'd hadsignificant, long-term relationships with people of both sexes.And the films they showed were of sex between two men orsex between two women, with bi men supposed to be turnedon by the lesbian action. Duh! That's how you find out who isstraight!It seems a lot of to do about nothing. But I'm particularlysensitive to it because I do have very good friends who arebisexual and they are one of the last groups even gays happilydiscriminate against -- bi? Yeah, right, they say. Why is it sohard to believe that since some people are primarily attractedto people of the opposite sex and some people are primarilyattracted to people of the same sex that some people are ableto have meaningful sexual and emotional relationships withpeople of both sexes. I'd find it more shocking if there weren'tbisexuals.
