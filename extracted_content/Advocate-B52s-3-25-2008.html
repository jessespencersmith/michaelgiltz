The B-52s, the world's greatest partyband,
comes out (in more ways than one) with its first
new album in 16 years By MTcHAEL Grlrz
WHEN THE B-52s first formed in1976, Jimmy Carter was about to
win the White House. The iast time they released an album of original
material-in 1992-Clinton was on his wayto takingover for Bush Sr. And
as their first offering in t6 years hits the stands March 25, the country is
abuzzwithtalkof theDemocraticPartymakinghistory.
"We won't do an album without a Democrat in the White House,"
jokes B-52s guitarist Keith Strickland.
Whether you credit politics, the rise of derivative acts like Scis-
sor Sisters and Mika, or a surge of creativity from a band that's never
stopped touring behind classics like "Roam" and "Planet Claire," +<.

the B-52s are finallyback.
Whlle Funplexreflects Strickland's love
of electronica, there's no doubt the album
sounds like vintage B-52s, thanks to songs
like "Pump," which played on TheLWord,
"Love in the Year 3000," and "Keep This
Party Going"-goofy, deliciously surreal
numbers that celebrate the mall, autoerot-
icized human beings, and, yes, partying.
This seems in keeping with singer Fred
Schneider's advice for his fellow Ameri-
cans: "Forgetthe Republicans. Put all those
right-wingers and religious nuts on the
North Pole and let God take care of them.
Everyone inAmerica should take off their
clothes and have a good time."
But something has changed for the
B-52s since the release of Good Stuff-they
got a little queerer. While it has long been
know that the three original male band
members (Strickland, Schneider, and the
late Ricky Wilson) were gay, redheaded
bombshellKate Piersonhas come out about
her relationship with Monica Nation. (The
two own Kate's Lazy Meadow Motel in
Mount Tremper, N.Y) Kate and Monica
have been open about their relationship for
some time, though it will likely come as a
surprise to manyfans.
"Well, it was news to me," Strickland
says with a laugh.
For his part, Schneider doesn't remem-
ber how he found out. "Maybe she sent out
an e-mail saying'I'm a lesbian,"'he says,
adding "\Me were gonna ostracize her. We
wdnt the press! Stay in!"
f the B-52s had recorded nothing but
"Rock Lobster," the band would live on
wherever there was a party. But songs
like "Cosmic Thing" "Private Idaho"
(the inspiration for Gus Van Sant's film My
OwnPrivate Idahd. and "Love Shack" haveunderscored their message
that misfits would someday
rule the world.
That battle cry was likely
forged when Ricky Wilson
and Strickland were still two
closeted teens.
"Ricky is my first friend
who came out," says Strick-
land, who lives in Key West,
FIa., with his partner, Mark
Hayda. 'And it was really cute
howhe did it. He satme down
on a sofa and he said, 'Ricky
Wilson is gay.' At fi rs! because
he was speaking in the third
person, I was a little confused.
But then I was like. OK. that's
cool. I think it was six months
later that I came out."
When Strickland met
Schneider at the Universitv
of Georgia, the queer misfit group grew. "I
met Fred at a street dance," he remembers.
'At this time I was very flamboyant and
I was really into the whole glitter scene. I
had longhair, but I teased it out, and I wore
makeup, and I'd wear like silver 1am6 pants.
I was/cr more outrageous than I ever was
in the band. I saw two people dancing out
of this whole crowd listeningto the music.
I thought, They lookinteresting. The guy
was Fred, and they looked at me and kind
of laughed."
The B-52s famously formed one night
after heavy drinking at a Chinese restau-
rant when a friend of Schneider's insisted
they perform at her Valentine's Day party.
So Schneider, Strickland, Wilson, Wilson's
sister Cindy, and Pierson came up with six
songs (including "Rock Lobster'), most of
which would appear on their eponymous
debut CD and are still live staples today.
The party almost stopped when Ricky
Wilson died of AIDS complications in 1985.
The band had been only quietly open un-
til then. "Especially if you're in a rock and
roll milieu," says Schneider, "you just don't
trumpet it. We didn't back then. If people
asked, yes."
But theywere forthright aboutWilson.
"It was actually the same month, I think,
Rock Hudson died," recounts Strickland.
"There was a lot of fear around it and a lot
of ignorance. People just didn tknow. What
is this? How do you get it? But he was very
brave, very brave, and went very quickly.
They just didn't have the drugs they have
now. Of course, after that we didn t think
that we could continue without Ricky."
The band had an album almost com-
pleted when Wilson died called Bouncing
Offthe Satellites. But it was the album Cos-
mic Thing three years later that would pro-
pel the B-52s to stardom and honor theirfriend's memory the best.
'A friend ofours said he felt like the al-
bum was a funeral in New Orleans," says
Strickiand, "where the musicians sing and
clap their hands behind a funeral proces-
sion and celebrate a person's life. There's a
lot of reflection on that album. Itwas abit-
tersweet success, defi nitely."
Selling 4 million copies in the United
States, Cosmrc ?hing produced two top-10
hits with "Love Shack" and "Roam" and
turned the cult band into MTV mainstays.
Ifthe piled-up hair and vintage clothing
didn't prove the B-52s weren't your typi-
cal band, Cindy's announcement that she
was leaving to be closer to her family-at
the height oftheir success-did. For the re-
cord, Strickland says she never really quit;
shejust took a leave ofabsence.
But their record company, Reprise-
suddenly realizingthatthis eccentric group
was a massive chart success-pressured
them to record a new album and tour. The
result, GoodStuJf,wasrushed and, to some,
unsatisfying. But a good thing did come out
ofit. Strickland decided to come out pub-
licly once and for all.
"Wehad allbeenout in ourprivate lives,"
he says. "The funny thing is, we were never
asked in the press, and no one in the record
company ever said aq,thing. We were writ-
ingGood Stuff fwhich was overtly political
by B-52s standards], and I felt like I wanted
to get it out there and get it over with.
"I was really moved by Madonna," he
continues. "She's not gay, but she's really
supportive. Why should I hide being gay?
Why is it something I should be afraid of
talking about? There is often legitimate
fear depending on where you live, but you
just have to be verybrave and be an adult."
And that's where the B-52s are today-
adult but still ready to have fun.
. "I didn't smoke anypot for the first time
while doingthis album-maybe once," says
Schneider. "I'm really happy that I could
channel whatever nuttiness without smok-
ing pot every day."
Solo albums, side projects, families, and
lovers have all helped B-52s return stron-
ger than ever. And if the message remains
the same, it's one worth repeating. While
renting avideo in Woodstock, N.Y., Strick-
land was recognizedbythe clerk. She said,
"Oh, the B-52s meant so much to me. I
never knew if any of them were gay. But it
didn't matter because they made me feel
good about being gay myself."
"Gosh, what a badge," he says. "Some-
thing like that really means more to me than
an award. You put out somethingthat made
someone feel good about herself. That has p
been our message: It's OK to be different. i
Make it work for you. Be yourself. There's *
not goingto be another like you." * q
