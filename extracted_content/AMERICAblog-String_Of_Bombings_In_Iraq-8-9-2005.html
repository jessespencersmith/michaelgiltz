8/09/2005 11:50:00 AMThe MSM should be blistering Bush/Scotty with questions aboutplans to pull out troops beginning in the spring. Even under thenon-reality-based world of Bush, there is no way to pretendthat things are stabilizing in Iraq. A string of bombings killed17 yesterday. Other fun news: the mayor of Baghdad was firedand no one knows why and people rioted in a Shiite citybecause of no dependable electricity or water.Is there any reason other than midterm elections for Bush topull out troops beginning in the spring? The insurgency isstronger than ever, bombers are ripping the country apart andeven the US can't keep the country stable.Soldiers on the ground insist they need more troops. Everyoneknows Bush has enough soldiers to "clear out" a city ofinsurgents but not enough to keep the city secure. As soon asthey pull out, more insurgents go back in. Doesn't Iraq needmore troops, not less?Numerous reports make clear that claiming Iraq has 170,000troops is at best grossly misleading. Can Bush break that downfor us? How many troops are capable of fighting on their own?Isn't that the only figure that matters? Numerous reportsindicate that they don't even have enough EQUIPMENT for170,000 troops, much less that many soldiers. Other reportssay most of those soldiers just show up for a check or nevereven existed in the first place. Who determines this number?How is it broken down? How do we confirm it with our ownintelligence?If Iraq only has 2000 troops capable of fighting on their own;9,000 troops capable of fighting with our help and most of therest of the soldiers claimed don't even exist or just show up toget their check, how can Bush even be thinking of pulling outtroops in time for midterm elections?
