PLAYWRIGHTS  HORIZONS
We could talk about the confusing, ambitious but misguided mess that is Marlane Meyer's
play The  Patron  Saint  Of  Sea  Monsters.  Or we could talk about the actors that all manage
to find some humor and heart throughout this disorienting show.
Let's talk about the actors. They're ensnared in a down home Gothic comedy about white
trash, a pure hearted doctor with a free clinic and crimes of the heart. It begins withCandy Buckley chomping down with glee on a big chunk of scenery as the scary, hard-drinking and hard-smoking and hard-loving mother of Calvin Little (sad sack RobCampbell). His wife is dead, seemingly at Calvin's hands though we're not sure whathappened for most of the play, and he feels real bad but would rather dispose of the bodythan fess up to the law. His slightly psychotic brother Jack -- half-brother! insists Calvin -- okay, half-brother Jack (Danny Wolohan) takes care of the body.
We're just getting started. Aubrey Lincoln is the doctor working a local free clinic who has
been obsessed with Calvin since she was a kid. When she's not praying to an obscure saintalmost perfect for her situation, Aubrey is staring up the cooch of Calvin's mom, tendingto his friends, ignoring the puppy love of Canadian Bill (Haynes Thigpen) and pining forCalvin. Toss in some work buddies who are worried about Calvin when he gets canned andJack's fearful wife and you've got yourself a haphazard jumbo of plot points.

<p>Oddly, the show helmed by director Lisa Peterson switches from broad comedy to
exceptionally pointed political commentary (meant as a further joke, no doubt) to serious
drama and then right back to the nutty, Christopher Durang-like stuff. Little of it works
and anything that does i undercut by the stylistic switches of the scenes before and after
it. Despite Heisler's best effort, Aubrey is the most frustrating of all -- she switches from a
kooky, mother-dominated mouse to a pistol-packing mama to a very sensible, sober
woman with a clear-eyed appraisal of her prospects. Instead of the evolution of one
character, it feels more like she's playing different people, the same way most of this
ensemble tackles multiple roles.
That makes it all the harder for Rob Campbell to make sense of Calvin's journey but he
mostly does, with a genial, winning-loser in the manner of Steve Buscemi style that serves
Calvin well since he's usually kind of trying to do the right thing.
Rachel Hauck's set is a bit of a junk shop, but manages to offer up multiple settings
quickly enough, aided by the tawdry costumes of Paloma Young. The animal masks
donned by actors and crew when making scene changes are about as effective in setting
mood as anything else in Meyer's play, which is to say it just befuddles you.
Still, most everyone shines at certain moments, which proves how lucky Meyer is with this
cast. Wolohan has hilarious intensity as Jack and Thigpen is wistful as Canadian Bill, whoactually seems like a good fit for Aubrey though she and the play don't seem to know it.Buckley overacts appropriately at every opportunity and Heisler is good at her final scene,though the fight engineered between her and Calvin for some brief conflict before theclosing feels forced and confusing. (What exactly are they arguing about?)
Campbell has a very effective monologue about what happened when he killed his wife
that quiets the audience and achieves some genuine pathos. Like everything else here, itcomes out of nowhere and kind of goes nowhere but Campbell shows faith in the storyand the character and creates some magic. Actors like that are the patron saints ofdeveloping playwrights everywhere.
DIE  FRAU  OHNE  SCHATTEN/THE  WOMAN  WITHOUT  A  SHADOW  ** 1/2 OUT
OF ****
METROPOLITAN  OPERA
In typical operatic fashion, Richard Strauss and librettist Hugo Von Hofmannstahl turned
a modest fairy tale into a four hour opera (including breaks). But Die  Frau  OhneSchatten/The  Woman  Without  A  Shadow  created an offstage bit of Cinderella going to the
ball thanks to Christine Goerke's magnetic, stirring portrayal of the Dyer's Wife. A thrillingdramatic soprano, she has been a Met baby for much of her career, having been part oftheir young singer's program in the 1990s. But she overcame vocal issues to make a returnhere and when I saw the show Tuesday night tore through the house with a huge,penetrating voice that took your breath away. I'm thoroughly untutored in opera butthought, there's a Brunnhilde if I ever heard one. I planned to do a little research and
make sure she was vocally suited to the part, but before I could, lo and behold the Met
has announced that Goerke will indeed sing that titanic part  when they bring back the
Robert Lepage Ring Cycle in the 2018-2019 season.
Less happy news can be found elsewhere in this production, whose physical design and
directorial touches undermine an excellent orchestra and generally fine singing. As I said,the story is simple. The Emperor (Torsten Kerl) once snagged the magical Empress (AnneSchwanewilms) for his wife. She used to be able to change shapes until losing hertalisman. Now she is in human form but without a shadow. Her father has demanded shelay hold of a shadow in three days time or she'll be banished and her husband theEmperor will turn to stone. In desperation, she and her nurse (Ildiko Komlosi) head down</p>
<p>to the world of mortals where they find a generally happy couple saddened by their lack of
children. The Nurse hates humans and doesn't mind meddling in their lives; she tempts
the Dyer's Wife (Christine Goerke) with jewels and a fantasy lover in exchange for thatprecious shadow. The Empress is more loving and feels doomed. If she rejects the shadow,her husband turns to stone. If she takes the shadow, the love of the Dyer (Johan Reuter)and his wife will be destroyed forever.
It's a demanding opera, not least because Strauss has filled his score with a huge busy
mass of instruments. Passage after passage is so heavily orchestrated the singers must belt
out merely to be heard. However mindful conductor Vladimir Jurowski may be of the
singers, the score simply must be delivered at its full-bodied might to be appreciated. That
he does, with certain passages like the prayer of the night watchmen to married couples,
especially lovely and a consistent engagement throughout.
Still, it does mean many of the singers are overwhelmed. Kerl in particular seemed
dwarfed by the music; it didn't help that he and Schwanewilms remained so distant from
each other you felt no palpable chemistry between the Emperor and the Empress. Komlosi
as the bitter nurse fared little better, though she rose to the challenge during her tortured
final passage where the Nurse is banished to the world of mortals for being such a pill.
Johan Reuter as the very understanding Barak, the Dyer is much better. He too is
dominated by the music at times -- almost as much as he's dominated by his wife. But hisacting is so strong and his magnetic attraction to his love is never in doubt. It's a credit tohim and Goerke that some of the most effective moments don't involve singing at all, butmerely their demonstration of pain and desire as they're batted about by forces largerthan them.
So the women are the stars here. Schwanewilms is regal to a fault as the Empress. It's
unfortunate that for much of act two she must remain on stage with nothing much to singor do other than look pained. But she shines in Act Three. Here Strauss drops away thenon-stop ornamentation and allows a simple pure backdrop for the Empress as shewrestles with her moral dilemma and decides beautifully that ultimately we judgeourselves and she can't bring herself to ruin other people's lives.
The production by Herbert Wernicke premiered to acclaim in 2001 but certain touches
have not aged well, if they ever worked. The Emperor's beloved Falcon (Jennifer Checkdoing modern dance in a very abstract costume of features) looks more like somethingfrom American  Horror  Story  than a winged creature. Worse, the Empress looks lovely in
sparking white but she's often thrown a blue shawl over it that seems more appropriatefor Stevie NIcks than this half-human, half-spirit creature. Dowdy is not a word thatshould spring to mind when looking at the Empress.
I faulted Komlosi earlier but she's burdened with the night's worst touch: the Nurse must
lug around a large triangular magical mirror. She has to sing arias with it, waggle it atpeople when creating magic and tuck it under her arm when walking around. It's anabsurd, ungainly distraction that serves no purpose other than to call unwelcome attentionto itself. Finally, while having the Empress backdropped by a black, empty stage duringher moment of crisis is apt, it seems odd to keep that stage just as bare and empty for thehappy finale, especially since that drawn-out happy ending takes ages for Strauss andHofmannstahl to wind up.
But all you'll remember anyway is Goerke. Her acting is superb throughout. And her voice!
It rides the orchestra with ease, cutting throughout without ever becoming strident or
piercing. Expressing anguish over her lack of children, berating her loving but suffering
husband, pleading to be released from her misery -- at every stage Goerke was in fullcommand both dramatically and vocally. Schwanewilms made her Met debut as theEmpress and acquitted herself well. But she's standing in the shadow of Goerke, who issuddenly the next big star for the company, with lead roles in Strauss's Elektra  and
Puccini's Turandot  as well as Ortrud in Wagner's Lohengrin  circa Robert Wilson's
production and of course Brunnhilde in the Ring Cycle. As the New York Times saidtoday, it's a fairy tale ending, or rather beginning.</p>
