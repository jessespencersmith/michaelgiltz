Laura **** FoX, $14.98 
DETECTIVE Dana Andrews 
falls in love with the just­
murdered Laura (Gene Tierney), 
a bewitching woman with a lot 
of people who wanted her dead. 
That haunting score by David 
Raskin probably helped. Lots of 
extras on this classic 1944 film 
noir, including two commentary 
tracks, two A&E Biography 
specials (on Tierney and 
Vincent Price) and more. And 
don't forget Clifton Webb's 
career peak as the acerbic Waldo 
Lydecker. Other noirs just out: 
1948's "Call Northside 777" and 
1950's "Panic in the Streets" (Fox, 
$14.98 each). 
Easter Parade *** Warner Bros., $26.99 
IF balding Fred Astaire 
(nearly 50) wasn't almost twice 
as old as his co-star Judy 
Garland (just 26), this Irving 
Berlin romantic musical from 
1948 might have been a real 
classic instead of hard-to­
swallow. Still, they're troupers 
and you can't beat 17 Irving 
Berlin tunes. Sterling extras 
include an excellent American 
Masters documentary "Judy 
Garland: By Myself." Other 
musicals just out: 1953's "The 
Band Wagon: Special Edition" 
(Warner Bros., $26.99) and 
1954's "Brigadoon" (Warner 
Bros., $19.97). Stand By Me: 
Deluxe Edition ***'/2 Columbia, $24.96 
THE latest DVD 
gimmick? Including a 
bonus CD with the 
soundtrack. "Stand By 
Me" (1986) comes 
with a disc including 
"Lollipop," and the 
title tune by Ben E. 
King, which re­
entered the charts, 
thanks to this sleeper 
hit. The great cast 
includes Kiefer 
Sutherland. In a twist, 
2000's "Miss 
Congeniality: Deluxe 
Edition Gift Set" 
(Warner Bros., $39.92) 
comes with the 
soundtrack to the 
sequel and a free 
movie pass to see it. 
Hogan's ·Heroes: 
First Season **,!, 
Paramount , $38.99 
A sitcom about life in a 
German prisoner of war camp 
during World War II? Surely 
"Hogan's Heroes" remains one 
of the unlikeliest hits in TV 
history -especially considering 
its 1965 premiere was only 20 
years removed from the end of 
the war. Silly but harmless. 
End of the Century: 
The Story of The 
Ramones *** Rhino, $19.99 
DEE Dee's manic count-off 
for every tune 
"Onetwothreefour!" -would 
have been a more fun title for 
this look at the legendary New 
York band. But "End ofthe 
Century" captures the 
bittersweet feel of this fine 
documentary about a group 
that influenced everyone from 
the Clash to Green Day.</p>
