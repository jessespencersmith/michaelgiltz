ffiritish author Philip
ff# Puliman has acirievcd
ffi almost everything he
ELF could imaeine with
his fantasy triiogy, "Ifis
Dark Materials."
The 55.year-old writer,
iaterviewed from his
home in Oxford on his
birthday, has received crit-
icai orarse. sold more than
a million copies of tire se-
ries a-nd staked a claim as
the iatbst professor from
that universit)' - along
with J.R.R. Tolkicn, C.S.
Lewis and Leu.is Carroll
- to write a great work of
fantasy.
But thcre's one thing
Pulln',an hasn't achieved
with the trilogl:, which
comprises "The Golden
Compass." "Tiie Subtle
Ihife" and "The Amber
Spyglass," and r.hici: Dei
Rey has just published il
paperbacli: controversy.
"I must confess, I am a
iittle surprised," ad-urits
Pulima-u, who will be at
the Uaion Square Barnes
& Nobie at 6 p.m. Tuesday
to promote thc paperback
release, along with the
charming audio version,
which features an entire
cast and Pulimal as narra-
tor (Listening Library).
"After al!, here i am kill-
ing God,'t sa)rs Pullman,
referrine ro the rcbellious
angels in his trilogy who
battle a God-like "Author-
itv."i'I wculd have thoueht irl
a country as renglous as
the United States, there
mieht harre been one ortwo readers picking up on
that," he sayd,' e.rt "oo6odi'
seens t<l have noticed
vet."
I.iobody, that is, except
fellow authors. They-"'e
long been familiar rvith his
work, especially tire rnar-
veious Victoriaa trilogy
featuring Salh' Loc khar-t.
J.tr(. Rowiing, author cf
the Harrv Potter books
(thai some have tried to
ban from school libraries),
has trumpeted Pullman,
rthose works, like hers,
are read by bc',i kids a:rC
adults.
Rowling told me y'g3ig
aso in one of her first
Almerican interviews, "If
he wrote in any genre
other than children's fic-
tion. he would be much
better knolln and ac-
claimed as one of the best
wriiers working today."
Elorror and fantasy nov-
elist Clive Barker is also a
fan-
"Oh, I love ttrem," says
Barker of Pullman's books.way through the wriring of
the trilogy, aad I thcught
ne was lust Delng cneelry.
But sexualiq' is ai the
heart of these bocks -
though tlgre is nothi:rg
more el?lrcrt than a pas-
sionate kiss in any of
thers-
"In part, they're about
the awakening of 'rite sex-
rral impulse, the awaken-
iag of the body," says Full-
man" who is malried and
has two sons. "Tiris is ttre
thins that Tolkien imores
and-Lewis activeii sup-
presses and condeu.ins." -
Now, afier more than
seven years of worli, Puli-
man can en'iov the success
of his booki. 'iA,fter a-11, not
everyone attempts to re-
write moral history or use
a classic like "Faradise
what Puliman is tackling:
Basically, it's a reimagin-
ing of Milton's "Paradise
Lost," with l,ullman stag-
ing ari epic batile befweenRings' having sex?" Pull-
man asked durine an
eariier inter-view at his
home. "Of course not."
