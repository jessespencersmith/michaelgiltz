IVANOV  *** out of ****
CLASSIC  STAGE  COMPANY,  NYC
Theater is so ephemeral: see the same show with the same cast one week earlier or one
week later or with a different audience and you might well have three subtly differentreactions. Not enough is made of when  a show is seen. So let's be clear, especially with the
havoc that Sandy caused in the theater world -- I saw this show on a Saturday when theyhadn't even had power in the theater a day or two before, much less been able to rehearseor perform. (Needless to say, that doesn't compare to the very real havoc in people's lives.)
In fact, going to see Ivanov  was one of the first times I'd left my Long Island City
neighborhood since the storm. Despite an hour on the train and then walking 30 or so
blocks to get there, it was very welcome indeed. But the cast was forced to launch intocritics' performances from a standstill. (With so many dates cancelled, it was impossibleto reschedule every critic even though the opening night was changed to November 15 andthen November 11. So I saw it on November 3, which was meant to be the night before it
opened but turned out to be a substantial 8 days before it really did and 12 days before
they hoped. That's a major difference for a limited run Off Broadway show.)
Ivanov  has many strengths and given the track record of everyone involved, I imagine by
the official opening night it had improved even more. Anyone lucky enough to see this
show late in its limited run might well see a production that's even better than what the
critics saw. These variables are always in play (though not always to such a dramaticextent) so it seemed only fair to point that out here.
It's another strong entry by Classic Stage Company, which continues to be one of the most
dependably strong purveyors of theater in the city. An early work by Chekhov (who hadgained fame for his short story writing), it's not in the league of his masterpieces but isabsorbing nonetheless. It begins here with Ivanov (Ethan Hawke) lounging and reading inmorose quiet while the audience streams in. Life is not easy for Ivanov: his wife Anna(Joely Richardson in a dignified turn) is dying of TB and her doctor (playwright JonathanMarc Sherman) urges -- no, demands  -- that Ivanov send her away. But he is broke and
deeply in debt.
Ivanov's estate manager (an exuberantly amusing Glenn Fitzgerald) is a fount of ideas for
money making but Ivanov cannot be motivated to act. He'd rather spend his days visitingthe friendly Lebedev (director Austin Pendleton), even if that means confronting Lebedev'spenny-pinching wife (Roberta Maxwell) who has lent Ivanov 9000 rubles and wants hermoney. It's worth it perhaps to bask in the glow of their daughter Sasha (Juliet Rylance,wonderful as always), who worships everything about Ivanov. It's almost enough to makehim believe in himself. Almost.

<p>This first play is also the source of Chekhov's famous dictum that if you introduce a pistol
in Act One it better be fired by the end of the play. So it's no surprise when the show endswith Ivanov finally taking decisive action to end his lethargic, quietly damaging life. Aswith the best productions of Chekhov, getting to that sad and tragic end involves scenesthat are surprisingly boisterous and fun.
Fitzgerald has puckish fun as Borkin, looking to play matchmaker between an aging Count
(George Morfogen in a self-deprecating turn) and a woman loaded with money (StepahnieJanssen) so he can collect the fee for bringing them together. It's an amusing subplot thathas a genuine emotional snap when the Count finally does the noble thing and ends thefarce by roughly pushing her away.
Indeed, the show is all about people doing the right thing when they can, even if doing so
may seem cruel to those around them. Director Austin Pendleton (stepping into the role of
Lebedev with his usual intelligence and ease) presents the play in this translation by Carol
Rocamora with clarity. The CSC somehow always brings out the best in set designers and
Santo Loquasto does not disappoint with simple choices that immediately establish the
homes of Ivanov and his friend Lebedev, the world encroaching and peeking in on his
privacy and the stage of outdoor gatherings where servants can serve and the somewhat
lower class Borkin can feel he has a place...as long as he's amusing. The costumes by
Marco Piemontese are especially lovely and detailed, subtly registering the faded flower
aspect of Anna, the blooming beauty and innocence of Sasha, the worn and frayed dignity
of Ivanov, the business-like and purposeful snaps and buckles of Borkin and so on. The
lighting by Keith Parham and original music and sound design by Ryan Rumery aresimilarly thoughtful.
Of course front and center are the actors. Though I'm certain they've grown better, they
were already a fine ensemble under less than ideal circumstances at my performance.Hawke has thoroughly enjoyed some big, juicy roles delivered with thunder in recentyears. He takes advantage of the intimate space here to deliver a quiet, subtle performancethat makes sense of a rather frustrating character. He has a few moments of foot-stomping fireworks, but what I'll remember most from him here is that marvelous voiceand the look of sadness in his eyes even at Ivanov's happiest moments. It helps to havetwo marvelous women tugging at you: Richardson as Anna and Rylance as Sasha. Whatman wouldn't be tempted and conflicted in such a scenario?
Still, when Anna is dead and Sasha is preparing to marry him, the opening of Act Four
which is usually played for laughs is given a more complex spin here as Sasha genuinelyseems to not want to marry Ivanov, recognizing his flaws. That makes her later twists alittle confusing and random; why exactly is she desperate to marry him again two minuteslater? Rylance is almost too good here; since we accept so completely her insight, it makesit harder to accept her whipsawing change of heart the next moment.
But the central flaw is Sherman's performance as the doctor. One doesn't think in terms of
villains in Chekhov. But the doctor is the driver of this tragedy, dripping poison into theear of the ailing Anna, determined to "unmask" the double-dealing Ivanov (as he sees theman) to one and all. It's not hard to recognize that the one character so insistent on hishonesty is at best self-deluded. Rylance's take down of him is wonderfully satisfying, butonly for the verve with which she accomplishes it. Sherman's uninteresting, one-note takeon the doctor makes him a bore and someone we can't take seriously. Why would Annalisten to him? Why would anyone care about his denouncement of Ivanov? He's atiresome bore who denounces everyone  so who'd pay attention?
That lack of conflict keeps this solid, empathetic production from taking hold of ourimagination, dimming modestly the rather stirring image of the Count and Sasha andIvanov and Lebedev all surprising us with their humanity and their confused attempts todo no harm, one oath the doctor gave up on long ago.
CHECKERS  ** 1/2 out of ****
VINEYARD  THEATRE,  NYC</p>
<p>I find Richard Nixon endlessly fascinating in popular culture, whether it's Robert Altman's
one-man film starring Philip Baker Hall (the criminally under-appreciated Secret  Honor ),
his appearance in a teen comedy like Dick  or the countless biographies.
Playwright Douglas McGrath had the good idea to focus in on the Checkers speech. Nixon
was the Vice Presidential nominee with Eisenhower when rather flimsy charges of a secretfund were raised by the opposition. Nixon was left to dangle in the wind a bit (no onereally liked him in the campaign). Then he was given the rather remarkable ultimatum todeliver a speech in prime-time (paid for out of his own pocket), defend himself and makethe case to the American people. Even more bizarrely, Nixon was ordered to ask people tosend in their "vote" as to whether he should remain on the ticket.
This show looks at the machinations around that decision, what actually happened behind
the scenes and the final triumph he achieved, a bitter triumph of course since bitternesswas Nixon's specialty. It is essentially accurate from what I can gather looking at someNixon biographies in the various details (with one private moment a key exception).Checkers  provides two showcase roles for its leads. Anthony LaPaglia wisely doesn't do a
Nixon impersonation. He plays a character, but captures with certain physical details andvocal mannerisms the essence of this ill-at-ease man. Kathryn Erbe embodies Pat, thelong-suffering wife who sees the good in Dick. She enjoyed the days when they could
campaign out of the back of a station wagon, even when running for the Senate in 1950.
She hates the spotlight and politics and desperately hopes this is their last campaign. Boy,
did she marry the wrong man. Surrounding them are various minor roles, notably Lewis J.Stadlen as Murray, the fast-talking, cigar-chomping, vulgar political operative who rubsPat the wrong way but speaks the same language as Nixon: win. Win at any cost. The wigs
by Leah J. Loukas and costumes by Sarah J. Holden capture the periods nicely and
support the actors in their roles.
It's a good conceit lessened by the play's structure and the overall concept of how to tell
the story via scenic design and projections. First was the mistake to bookend the story of
the Checkers speech with Murray in 1966 meeting with Nixon and telling him it's now ornever if he wants to run for President again. Pat of course hates the idea but Nixon knows
this is his destiny. It's a tension-free framing given what we know and undercuts the
emotional high point of the play: a vow by Nixon to Pat during the run for VP that he will
never run for office again. (That's the one detail I couldn't confirm in the books Ireferenced, if standing in the aisle of the Strand and pouring over a number of Nixonbiographies counts as reference work.)
Stadlen has fun of sorts as Murray but it's a role he could do in his sleep and McGrath
doesn't help by hitting all the usual buttons with this guy. Drop the framing device andyou get to end with the Checkers victory and see Nixon genuinely make a pledge to Pat weknow he can't keep. Does he mean the pledge? Is he sincere? Or is he telling her what sheneeds to hear, just like any politician who wants to win? That ambiguous note in themidst of genuine affection would be far more penetrating if it were the end of the show.
The other problem is the production design itself. Director Terry Kinney directs as nimbly
as he can. But the script and the way to present it is cinematic in nature: Checkersinvolves an exceptional number of quick scene changes from place to place. Productiondesigner Neil Patel and projection designer Darrel Maloney have worked together to makecreative, nifty choices when leaping from a hotel room to a train to a diner and so on.Moment to moment, those projections (almost a specialty of the Vineyard) and Patel's setswork beautifully. The problem is that there are literally so many  changes. A scene barely
starts when it's over and everyone is moving furniture here, tucking away chairs there andthe projections are giving us an indication of a new location.
This is not a lengthy play by any stretch but an exorbitant amount of time is spent simply
watching them switch things from one scene to the next. Hotel to diner to train tocampaign headquarters to tv studio to train and so on again and again and again. Youshouldn't be so aware of scene changes but here I was aware of little else. Each changewas clever and smoothly done but the cumulative effect was distracting. Put all that asideand you have two actors -- LaPaglia and Erbe -- enjoying the opportunity to play two</p>
<p>complex adults with intelligence and empathy. For many, that will surely be enough.
Here is Richard Nixon's Checkers speech, for those who can't make it to the show.
