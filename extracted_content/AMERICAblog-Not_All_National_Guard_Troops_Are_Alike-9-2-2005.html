9/02/2005 01:55:00 AMHere's an interesting detail from USA Today about the TYPES ofNational Guards that are here in the US versus the onesdeployed in Iraq:The problem for Louisiana and Mississippi isn't howmany troops are in Iraq, but rather the kind ofsoldiers who are there, said Dave McGinnis, a militaryanalyst who specializes in National Guard personnel issues."It's combat brigades, which are the types of units youneed in these situations," he said. Combat brigades —large, self-sustaining units of about 3,000 troops — havethe vehicles, communications equipment and structure tocope best with a natural disaster. In Louisiana,communications and mobility are especially critical becausemost of New Orleans is without water, power and telephoneservice.Apparently the most effective sort of Guard units for this situation areEXACTLY the Guard units that have been sent to Iraq. So the sheershortfall in numbers tells only half the story. Kudos of course to thebrave men and women doing a dangerous and difficult job. I'munclear as to the various types of training the Guard goes through orwhat sort of troops are on the ground in LA. But to make a bluntcomparison, you don't want cops to fight fires, you want firemen.Anyone know more or can link to info on this issue?
