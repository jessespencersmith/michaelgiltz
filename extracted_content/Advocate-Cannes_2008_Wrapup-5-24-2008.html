There are twoways to think about it: one, you hope to see the films that getawards, whether you like them or not because you want to beable to say you've seen them and two, you hope that of themovies you saw and really liked that the jury really liked themtoo. On both counts, I got very lucky this year. My favorite film-- The Class -- won the Palm d"Or. Two of my other favorites which were not as widely embraced by  international critics -- IlDivo and Linha de Passe -- also scored big wins.

<p>Directors Fortnight and a raft of recognition from other groupsthat announce their favorites of the fest. I knew that missingGomorrah was a bummer and so it proved. And ironically I'm ahuge fan of the Dardenne brothers but I thought the screenplayof their new film The Silence of Lorna was the weakest aspect ofthat movie and yet they won an award for it. O the other hand, Iwas mixed on Uc Maymum but thought the direction was thestrongest aspect and it won for that. Overall, the films I wasmost enthusiastic about did really well.CANNES GETS A WOODY FOR INDY AND MONSIEURALLENTwo of the splashiest highlights of the fest were the worldpremiere of "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the CrystalSkull" and Woody Allen's menage a troi romantic comedy"Vicky Cristina Barcelona." Indy had a queer spin for two bigreasons. First, the delightful Cate Blanchett had a ball playingthe nasty Russian villainess with a fabulous page boy haircutand an outrageous Boris & Natasha style accent. She'sconstantly barking out orders and looking extremelydominating and best of all showing no interest in Indywhatsoever. An even gayer moment occurs when Mutt (ShiaLaBeouf) makes his first appearance. Riding a motorcyclethrough the smoke, LaBeouf is decked out in leather to lookexactly like Marlon Brando in "The Wild Ones." But given hisage and general demeanor, LaBeouf looks less like a rebel andmore like one of the Village People. Really, his cap is tilted atsuch a jaunty angle and he looks like such a boy in that leatherjacket that a few people (ok, me) burst out laughing.The Woody Allen movie was more annoying than fun when itcame to the press coverage of the film. In the movie, PenelopeCruz and Scarlett Johansson kiss passionately in a photographydark room and later have a threesome relationship with JavierBardem (though we never see the two women or they andBardem in bed together). The very first question for Allenreferred to the threesome as a "classic male fantasy." Howabout the classic female fantasy of two women who desire eachother in which the man is the furthest thing from their mind?Next came Cruz, who gave such an indifferent answer to theinevitable questions about kissing Johansson. She answered ina bored voice, "I’ve had that question four times today. I didn’tgive any answer because I didn’t have a good answer. I’ve beenwondering what would Woody say in that situation and I’m stillnot inspired." Are we supposed to be so post-gay that askingabout being physically intimate with aother actor for a film istoo boring to broach? First, actors always get asked about whatit's like to kiss a co-star of the opposite sex. Second, actors getFilm FestivalsFood and DrinkIowa Caucus 2008LesbianMusicOutfest 2008PartiesPoliticsProvincetown Film Festival 2008Queen Mary 2 Historic CrossingReligionScienceSexSportsSydney Mardi Gras 2008Taylor Hanson for The AdvocateTelevisionThe DinahThe HRC Logo ForumThe L WordTheaterTravelRecent PostsMTV Video Music Awards...

<p>asked about imaginary things (like shooting guns, beating upbad guys, flying through the air) they pretend to do in movies.Third, when actors have a sex scene, it's (usually) just pretend.But when they kiss, they really kiss. They really do it. So whynot have some sort of playful, friendly answer rather than justacting as if the question is too boring or provincial or juvenile torespond to? Frankly, it's hard to tell whether they're toosophisticated or the issue actually makes them uncomfortable.And I'm sure that's the last thing a worldly actress and friend ofPedro Almodovar would want to imply.THE MOVIES I SAW AT THE FESTIVAL (from best to worst)Entre Les Murs/The Class **** (out of four)El Dorado *** 1/2Il Divo *** 1/2Linha De Passe *** 1/2Waltz With Bashir *** (out of four stars)The Good, The Bad and The Weird ***Of Time and the City ***O'Horten ***Hunger ***Elevre Libre/Private Lessons ***It's Hard Being Loved By Jerks -- The Trial ***Che ** 1/2Wendy and Lucy ** 1/2Vicky Cristina Barcelona ** 1/2Uc Maymum ** 1/2Rumba ** 1/2Synecdoche, New York ** 1/2Tyson ** 1/2Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull ** 1/2The Changeling/The Exchange **Un Conte de Noel/A Christmas Tale **Two Lovers **Acne **The Silence of Lorna **Tokyo Sonata **The Chaser * 1/2Sanguepazzo * 1/2La Mujer Sin Cabeza/The Headless Woman * 1/2La Frontiere De L'Aube/The Frontier of Dawn * 1/2Tokyo! * (three shorts; stayed for two)My Magic *What Just Happened? *Serbis -- no starsMovies I Missed and Regret:Gomorra, Leonera, 24 City/Er Shi Si Cheng Ji, Snow,vimax on Awards Night: Miniskirts, Musicals, andMamaomar on Amman SegregatesArchivesSeptember 2008July 2008June 2008May 2008April 2008March 2008February 2008January 2008December 2007November 2007September 2008SunMonTueWedThuFriSat 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930    Subscribe to this blog's feedAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/2008/05/cannes-smorgasb.html

Combine that with journalists from all overthe world who have their own obscure agendas ("Angelina,would you consider having your twins in Sweden?") and youjust never know what to expect. But you always know the starswill get some head-scratching puzzlers they try to answer aspolitely as possible, no matter how odd or obscure the questionmay be. Case in point, Steven Spielberg's first question after theworld premiere of "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of theCrystal Skull" from an Asian reporter for an outlet called "EpicTimes." After 19 years, the first Indy movie -- which probablycost $180 million or so to make -- has just debuted at theCannes Film Festival. This is the very first question asked at thepress conference.Reporter: Epic Times has declared that the Chinese earthquakepeople warned the authorities a week before the drama. Theauthorities decided not to pay attention to these warnings. Theyhave decided to review their own findings from these experts.As for your experience Spielberg, you have experience withcommunism. Did you get pressure on you that impeded yourliberty and freedom, and what about the work that some of youhave done about good and evil…uh, I apologize.

<p>SAPPHIC HIGHLIGHTS"Leonera" aka "Lion's Den" was a women-in-prison flick withprisoners aggressively hitting on our heroine. "Vicky CristinaBarcelona" featured Penelope Cruz and Scarlett Johanssonmaking out (though the women I spoke with felt Cruz wasn'tconvincing -- they thought her character would have been muchmore aggressive and passionate). Mischa Barton of "The OC"had a film in the market about two girls falling in love at aT.A.T.U. concert. Lisa Ray and Sheetal Sheth -- two actressesI'm unfamiliar with -- are apparently making a career of lesbianromances. Their previous film "The World Unseen" is in themarket paired with a new drama called "I Can't Think Straight,"which has the tagline, "Just another British, Indian, Muslim,Arab, Christian, lesbian romantic comedy." But they were alltrumped by real world events: when Lindsay Lohan kissed a girlat Cannes, it immediately exploded onto gossip pages all overplanet.THE BEST PARTY I WASN'T INVITED TOActor Alan Cumming was apparently at Cannes and staying onDenise Richards' yacht. Naturally, there was a party. Not beingfabulous, I wasn't invited.DIRECTOR TERENCE DAVIES RETURNS TO FILMMAKINGOut British director Terence Davies has made two of myfavorite films of all time: "Distant Voices, Still Lives" and "TheLong Day Closes." His two other features are "The Neon Bible"and acclaimed period film "The House of Mirth" starring GillianAnderson. Davies has been struggling to get financial backingfor a number of projects ever since then, including the periodfilm "Sunset Song," another movie that's a murder mystery ornoir (I think) set in New York City and says he's now just aboutready to shoot a romantic comedy. But it's been eight yearssince "Mirth," so it's a delight to have something from him, inthis case "Of Time and the City," a documentary, or really adocu-poem to his hometown of Liverpool. I covered the filmbelow on Day Six. At roundtables for the film, Davies wasamusing and friendly, though clearly delivering his usualroutines for the various reporters. (It's inevitable that youdepend on a few well-chosen lines when you speak to dozens ifnot hundreds of reporters and they all invariably ask the samequestions.) But one moment stood out. In the film, Daviesspeaks about a boy he liked and longed to emulate -- amasculine boy named Jimmy Preston who once rested his armon Terence's shoulder and -- as Davies narrates in the film -- "Ididn't want him to take it off." I was going to ask Davies what itwas like to use the real name of a boy you'd had a crush on inAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/2008/05/cannes-smorgasb.html

<p>childhood when he mentioned that after 48 years and quite outof the blue Jimmy Preston contacted him last week. Davies saidPreston was going to see the film at an event in Edinburgh."Does he know you fancied him?" I asked. "He will after hewatches the film," laughed Davies.NAZIS ON THE MOON!There's an entirely different festival -- the business side ofCannes -- that most journalists like me never cover beyond thebig announcements, such as the Weinstein Company sayingthey're gonna make Paolo Coelho's "The Alchemist" withLaurence Fishburne directing and starring. I always make atleast one or two trips to the lower level of the Palais to stroll theaisles and check out the endless posters of B movies that will gostraight-to-DVD (if that) in the US. But a little bit of the marketcame to my apartment building since on a lower floor, the BlindSpot/Wreck A Movie companies had set up shop to plug twofilms. One is a horror movie with grim gothic imagery depictinga man drowning in (or rising up from) a lake in a gloomy forest.The title is "Sauna" and the tagline is "Wash Your Sins." I giggleevery time I see it. But more intentionally funny is "Iron Sky," acomedy which insists that the Nazis built a rocket and fled tothe moon at the end of World War II and now they're comingback! Now that's a movie I want to see.PRESIDENT BUSH AT CANNESThe Bush administration popped up at Cannes in two ways.First, with five people stuffed into a one bedroom apartmentand three reporters constantly using WiFi to file stories, weeach set up camp at different corners of the place. Stephenwrote his reviews for Esquire.com on the couch or the table onthe patio. Sperling delivered his pieces for Film Stew from thelone desk and I perched my laptop on a counter in the kitchenarea which was within arm's reach of the fridge and a poweroutlet and looked out on the balcony. Sperling offered severaltimes to make room for both of us at the desk, but I was fine.However, since there was no bar stool available, this did mean Iwas standing up for hours at a time doing my typing. Mynickname during the fest? Rumsfeld.Even better, director Oliver Stone plugged his upcoming movie"W: The Improbable President" with a two-page spread inVariety that included a greatest hits compilation of Bushquotes, along with casting announcements like Josh Brolin asBush, Scott Glenn as Rumsfeld (but we look nothing alike!),Jeffrey Wright as Colin Powell and Toby Jones as Karl Rove(great choice, that one). The list of Bush quotes never fails tobrighten up my day. Among my favorites: "I'm honored toAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/2008/05/cannes-smorgasb.html

"They misunderestimated me.""I can press when there needs to be pressed; I can hold handswhen there needs to be...hold hands." "Families is where ournation finds hopes, where wings take dream." And, "I know thehuman being and fish can coexist peacefully."WACKY PRESS CONFERENCE QUESTION #2: WOODY ANDRUSSIAReporter: Question to Mr. Woody Allen. I'm from Uzbekistanand I'm sure this film is going to have huge success over therein Central Asia because in our [world] we still have manywomen in the family as wives. [General laughter.]  I really hopethat next film you will plan to do in Russia or Central Asia.  Ihope you have story to do with Russian actors. We havebeautiful actresses.Woody Allen: You're asking me if I plan to be shooting inRussia?Moderator: Or Uzbekistan or Kazakstan.Woody Allen: I have no plans at the moment. [laughter] Thethought had never occured to me, I'm sure. I'll tell you aninteresting story. Years ago, I visited Russia with my family. Iwas planning to be there in Leningrad for five days. I was therefor about two hours and I went to the travel agent in the hoteland said, ‘Get me the first reservation out of here. I don’t carewhere it goes.’ [huge laughter -- reporter shaking her head indismay] That was my memory of it. It was a terrible, terribletime when I was there. I haven’t been back since then and I’mtold that it’s greatly changed. But it would take a lot because I’ma fearful traveler and it would take a lot to get me back toRussia.MY ANNUAL FIGHT WITH SOMEONE ON LINE FOR A FILMEuropeans in general seem to think a line for a movie wasmeant to be jumped -- especially when they're French and theline is at the Cannes Film Festival. (This does not include theBritish, who of course love to queue up at the drop of a hat.)Combine that general attitude with an in-demand movie like"Che" and you've got a recipe for tension. Invariably, one movieat the fest is high in demand and located in a small location,making it impossible for even half of the 4600 journalists to getin to the first screenings. The result? Angry words, tension anda fight or two. This year, it wasn't even someone cutting in linethat I butted heads with. My friend Stephen got in line fourhours early and I got in line two hours early (with a much betterAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/2008/05/cannes-smorgasb.html

<p>badge, I didn't need to be as cautious as him). We were both atthe front of our respective lines, standing next to each otherwith a barrier dividing us and discussing Che. Behind us piledin more and more people, all desperate to see the movie,angling to keep their space. Then, with just a few minutes to gobefore everyone starts pushing in, a young French womansuddenly spots a friend, a handsome man coming out of theprevious screening and standing about a foot in front of me pastthe line. She shoves her way to the front and I politely standawkwardly to one side (there's no room to move and I'm reallycontorting myself to give her a moment with her friend). She ofcourse just pushed in between my friend Stephen and I to chatgaily away. And chat and chat and chat. I'm gettinguncomfortable in the yoga-like position I've adopted (StandingCat, I think), when after literally five long minutes I see theguards moving into position, which is the last signal before thechaos begins of letting us in. I say, "Si-vous plait" to her andgesture/ask her to move back again. Astonished, aghast at myinsolence, she barks at me, "I'm talking to my friend!" turnsback and starts talking again. I say, more angrily, "Si-vousplait!" and gesture firmly that no, the conversation is over. Sheis, if anything, even more astonished, says something to herfriend like, 'This fat American is such an ass!' and with manysighs and shock over my crass behavior pushes her way back toher line and starts gesticulating at me and speaking to thepeople around her in a loud voice about the insanity of myrequest. "Desole," I say half-mockingly as she continues. "I wastalking to my friend!" she says. "Yes, and I was talking to myfriend and I waited five minutes and finally asked you to moveback again. They're about to let us in and everyone is tense."The key issue is that whenever there's a major line, people getanxious and annoyed when others stroll up to talk with friendsor seem to be cutting the line in one way or another.  Shecontinued to act aggrieved, making snorting noises for severalminutes and talking to her friends. Finally, when her attentionwas elsewhere, the people around me leaned in and one afteranother thanked me in low-key whispers. (They were behindme but ahead of her in line so they would have been the onesmost affected by her cutting ahead and believe me, time andtime again you can be the last person to get into a screening ormiss out by being two or three people away from the front whenthe doors are shut in your face and the sign syaing "Complet" isposed. "I think you were right," said one woman. "Don't tell me;tell her," I laughingly responded. But of course no one wantedto start her up again. Then we all rushed in, I grabbed two seatson the far right for my friend and I and we spent the next fourand a half watching "Che"...with the French woman I foughtAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/2008/05/cannes-smorgasb.html

<p>with sitting right in front of me.SEARCHING FOR THE GAYThe entire festival, I'm always on the lookout for movies withany queer content, whether obvious or subtle. While I'd preferto ignore the plot summaries provided in fest catalogs, I usuallyglance through them searching for any gay (sub)plots or hintsof something same-sex erotic. Those plot descriptions are oftenterribly vague -- not to mention translated into English afterbeing translated into French from say Spanish or German -- sogood clues can also be found in the photos. I also badger friendsevery day about gay content in the movies they see. (Withhundreds of movies on tap, we're often at different screenings.)Then they can tell me not to miss such and such a film. Oneday, my schedule opened up and I was looking forward to arelaxed sit-down meal before the evening movies began. Then Iglanced at the film playing in the Directors Fortnight, "ElDorado." The plot description of the Belgian film said, "Yvan, aquick-tempered 40 year old vintage car dealer, surprises youngElie trying to burgle him. But he doesn't beat him up anddevelops a strange affection for him." Damnit, I thought, thatsounds vaguely gay. I really wanted to relax but dutifullytrooped off to see it. It wasn't gay in the least (though writer,director and star Bouli Lanners would make a fine bear), but itturned out to be my biggest find of the fest. And since no oneelse I talked to saw the film, it would have remained unknownto me if I hadn't checked it out.I stayed at that location for the next film, "Acne," which was thelast movie of the night and one I planned to meet a friend for.(One more reason to check out "El Dorado.") I didn't expect anygay content and there wasn't really, though perhaps a gaysubplot had been excised. The film is about a 13 year old Jewishboy in (I think) Argentina. (The film is listed asUruguay/Argentina/Spanish/Mexican so damned if I knowwhere it's set.) In the film, our hero has another slightly olderkid at school who always says "Hi" to him in the hallway. Hisbuddies say, "Here comes your friend" when the other kid walksby. The guy definitely pays attention to our hero, though hebarely has five lines of dialogue. But at one point, they're bothaway at summer camp of some sort when late at night our herogoes to the communal bathroom after everyone is asleep. Theolder kid shows up. (Was he watching to see if our hero wouldbe out and about alone?) Then he offers a cigarette and lightsthem both up at the same time with his lighter in a PaulHenreid gesture that stirred my gaydar. My fellow movie-goerleaned over. "Is it about to get gay?" he asked. "Could be." Thenthe older kid said he liked the hero's hair and then asked if heAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/2008/05/cannes-smorgasb.html

<p>wanted to get stoned. Now my gaydar was off the charts, but thehero declined and the scene ended and the other kid was neverheard from again. Was some subplot cut from the film involvingthe older kid making a pass? I wouldn't be surprised or it couldbe completely my imagination. But that's the effort I go to justfor you.WACKY PRESS CONFERENCE QUESTION #3: CHARLIEKAUFMAN'S GAY AGENDAReporter #1: Would you say that you understand loneliness?Charlie Kaufman (writer-director of "Synecdoche, New York"):Um, I'm not sure I understand anything. I've experiencedloneliness.... But to understand it, I'm not sure what thatmeans.Reporter #2: How should we consider homosexualrelationships are...are heroes in your film? Is it some kind ofcritic or irony or whatever or is it some story, that's all?Charlie Kaufman: Is it just a story?Reporter #2: Is it just a story or is just we should think of somekind of message you want to say about....Charlie Kaufman: No, no. I don't have any message. I don'treally have any message about anything but what happens inthe movie.Reporter #2: OK. Thank you.THE YEAR OF MARINAA personal note to end on. People come to Cannes with amillion movie proposals and ideas and dreams and most ofthem are lucky to make it to the basement of the Palais withsome straight-to-DVD flick that never really sees the light ofday. So this year is delightfully surreal to me. I've been going toCannes since 2000 and one of my roommates for several ofthose years was Marina Zenovich. She's a good friend of myroommate Stephen and I at first wasn't quite clear what she did.But over the years she would mention she was working on somedocumentary about Roman Polanski and no, she didn't expector need to get his cooperation to make the film. Imagine mysurprise when her film "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired"made its world premiere at Sundance, got rave reviews and willbe seen on HBO June 9. To qualify for the Oscars, the film hada one-week run in New York City, but they buried it at arun-down cinema on 183rd St. I trekked up there and paid my$10 to see it. At first I was relieved it didn't suck. (You knowhow awkward it is when you have to watch your friend's play orsee their band or read their book -- you just hope you can findsomething polite to say without struggling too hard.) Then Iwas pleased and finally jealous: the movie was really, reallyAdvocate Insiderhttp://www.advocateinsider.com/2008/05/cannes-smorgasb.html

<p>good. Now Marina has returned to Cannes and the film ismaking a specialized, prestigious debut in the main batch offilms Out of Competition. Filmmakers and producers andagents and hangers-on circle her the entire fest, she spendsendless hours giving a head-spinning number of interviews,goes to parties, dresses up for the big premiere and getsintroduced on the big stage as "realisatrix Marina Zenovich!" and walks out to huge applause. She's so busy I barely see herand I couldn't be happier -- it's a sign of what a big opportunitythis is for her and the admiration everyone has for her film.People really do come to Cannes and succeed tremendously. Itmay have been a slow fest for most people, but watching hertriumph has made it one of the happiest yet for me.
