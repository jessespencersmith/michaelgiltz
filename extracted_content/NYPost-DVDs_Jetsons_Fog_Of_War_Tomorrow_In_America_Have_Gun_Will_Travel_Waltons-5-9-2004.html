Q) 
z The Jetsons/Jonny Quest-* * * 1/2 
Warner Bros., $64.92 each 
"The Honeymooners" led to "The Flintstones," which led to 
"The Jetsons," the space-age family. This contains all 24 episodes 
from the show's original run in 1962, plus a look at the Jetsons' 
"futuristic" gadgets. More than 20 years later, they made 51 more 
episodes, but these are the best. 
The Fog of War 
*** Sony Pictures Classics, $26.96 
Filmmaker Errol Morris 
received a well-deserved Oscar 
for Best Documentary for this 
fascinating probing of the mind 
of Robert McNamara, the 
secretary of defense under 
presidents Kennedy and 
Johnson and self-described war 
crimes perpetrator. Morris lets 
McNamara apologize, analyze 
and forcefully defend his 
actions during World War II 
and Vietnam. 
Tomorrow ***1/2 HVE,$29.95 
This 1972 drama is about a 
solitary man who takes in a 
pregnant woman. (Think 
"Plainsong.") Extras include 
archival interviews, plus a copy 
of the William Faulkner short 
story the movie was based on. 
In America ***1/2 
Fox, $27.98 
A sentimental drama about 
Irish immigrants making a go 
of it in New York. It sticks with 
you mainly because of the 
women -Samantha Morton 
(right) , as the mom, and 
especially sisters Sarah and 
Emma Bolger, as Christy and 
Ariel, are wonderful. Have Gun, Will Ti'avel: 
Complete First Season ***1/2 
Paramount, $49.99 
This is an entertaining western 
about hired gun Paladin 
(Richard Boone) who would 
sometimes hunt down the 
people who'd employed him if 
he thought they were in the 
wrong. Also new in the everyÂ­
man-for-himself vein: 
"Survivor: Complete First 
Season" (Paramount, $49.99). 
The Waltons: 
-Complete First Season ***1/2 
Warner Bros., $49.98 
A wholesome drama rarely gets 
respect, whether it's NBC's 
"Providence," or the classic 
example that debuted in 1972, 
"TheWaltons." The stories 
were a bit sappy, but the acting 
was strong. No extras, but it 
was the Depression, after all, so 
maybe they couldn't afford any. r I
