RESULTS SHOW: For the second year in a row,
American Idol  had a stunning upset as Lee Dewyze
beat Crystal Bowersox to claim the American Idolcrown. One of the strengths of Idol  is that you don't
need to win in order to launch a career -- see Jennifer
Hudson, Clay Aiken, Daughtry and many others. But
with Simon leaving and both Adam Lambert andCrystal losing out to far less charismatic competitors,it's clear that American Idol has jumped the shark.
(And this isn't sour grapes. This year I voted for
Crystal. But last year I voted for Kris; I just didn't
expect him to win and realize the danger the show
faces when the final votes are out of whack with overwhelming expectations.)
The results show was jammed with the usual superstars -- but no Bonnie Raitt. Was that the first sign
that everything wouldn't go swimmingly for Crystal?
To an unusual degree, the superstar guests came off poorly. Alice Cooper was forced to endure the least
rocking version of "School's Out" ever recorded. Siobhan Magnus and Aaron Kelly sang with two vocallyshaky Gibbs brothers. Christina Aguilera had to postpone her tour but appeared (very briefly) on Idol .
Hall & Oates sounded okay but had some weird tempo changes and I don't think they ever looked at each
other once. Crystal traded some good vocal licks with Alanis Morissette on "You Oughta Know." Lots of
former Idols  popped in (though not David Cook) and -- hilariously -- we had a fond look back at all those
Ford Fiesta ads.
Bret Michaels came straight from the hospital to duet with Casey James on "Every Rose Has Its Thorn."
Lee sounded pretty good with Chicago on "25 or 6 to 4." Paula Abdul appeared for a drawn out goodbye
to Simon clearly expecting a lot more applause and laugh lines at various moments. Janet Jackson

<p>proved herself the queen of lip syncing on "Nasty Boys," combining recorded vocals in a much lower tone
with some live singing to make it sound like she was singing with someone else hiding off stage.
The highlight of the evening for me was hearing them play Sufjan Stevens of all people during a Chicago
montage. Then Lee and Crystal sang with Joe Cocker on the Beatles classic "With A Little Help From My
Friends." Joe sounded terrific and Crystal fit in so beautifully and seemed so comfortable with him
vocally it just emphasized that she was clearly the standout. Lee looked a little stunned, as always. (On
the plus side, Crystal and Lee's voices do sound good together; duets are in their future.)
Then it was all over, with Lee almost fainting even before the results were announced and then stumbling
through U2's "Beautiful Day." Hey, he's got a nice studio voice (as the judges might have said in years
past) and who knows, maybe he's a terrific songwriter. But Crystal is gonna pull a Clay Aiken on him and
deliver the goods. They can both flourish in their careers but there can be only one American Idol and toeveryone's surprise, it was Lee.
Do the results make you less likely to watch next season? Will you buy either of their albums? And who
can replace Simon?
PERFORMANCE SHOW:  In what even ardent fans must admit was the least musically exciting, least
dramatic finale in Idol  history, Crystal Bowersox received nothing but praise and Lee Dewyze heard -- at
best - polite mixed reviews for his performances. Bowersox continues her march to the winner's circle by
the biggest margin since Carrie Underwood was the odds-on favorite from the auditions to the finale. Ofcourse, it's a new era where an artist is lucky to go platinum, so it'll be interesting to see what happenswith Crystal's career. But barring any text-happy fans in Lee's hometown figuring out new ways to vote,Crystal will be the ninth American Idol.
It was an awkward night from the get-go, with Crystal goofily messing up her walk to the stage by
dropping her mike, getting turned around, missing her mark and generally looking lovably unpolished.
Lee sort of strolled to the stage, like a kid on a backstage tour. And that about summed it up.
Song #1  -- Lee chose to sing "The Boxer." My first thought was surely he could have picked a song where
he triumphed more from earlier in the season. But looking through the list of songs he's done, actually
there aren't a lot of stand-out performances. Maybe "Simple Man," but that was probably too recent. He
was ok, but not as good as his first time singing it. Simon had the line of the night about his lack of
passion: "That was a kiss on the cheek when I want a kiss on the lips." Crystal chose to sing "Me andBobby McGee." which maybe seemed a little too obvious. So I looked over her songs and found four orfive she nailed and could have done instead. But it's so clearly in her comfort zone, ultimately the choiceseemed right. And she was good if not transcendent; certainly better than Lee. The judges of course loved
her.
Song #2  -- This was the song chosen by the producers of the show and they made two dreadful picks,
which certainly didn't help. Lee was given R.E.M.'s "Everybody Hurts" which is a ballad (not a good
combo after his first song), and has an extremely difficult, drawn-out melody that probably doesn't suit
him. If you've ever heard people massacre the tune in karaoke bars, you know how hard it is to sing. Lee
seemed lost in the meandering melody and never got into a groove. The judges were as polite as theycould be, urging him to do better. If you have to urge someone to do better in the finals, something'swrong. Crystal was told to sing "Black Velvet," one of those tired Idol songs that has been done a
thousand times. Simon joked, "I'm almost allergic to that song." Crystal looked terrified as she tottered in
high heels at the top of the stairs, looking down once and then twice before finally braving it and startingto walk down. It's not a bluesy song so much as a faux bluesy song and Crystal did what she could do with
it. The judges raved.
Song #3  -- In a welcome switch, the contestants were given a classic tune to sing, rather than a bland
new ballad. Here's hoping this is an innovation they keep. Lee was given U2's "Beautiful Day," a terrific
rock song, if you can belt it out to the rafters. Lee was dwarfed by the tune, a line I wrote down during hisperformance. Kara echoed me by saying Lee was "swallowed up" by it, while all the judges tried to bepolite. Crystal was given Patty Griffin's lovely Martin Luther King Jr. tribute "Up To The Mountain" to
perform. Exhale. Finally, after a night of ho-hum moments, she hit one out of the park in a DVR-able
moment that was absolutely great. Just marvelous and a much needed reminder of why she was the clearwinner for months.
I was actually hoping they'd have Crystal and Lee duet on "Falling Slowly" again at the end of the show,
which would have been a nice kicker and a good reflection of how no one was out for blood this season.
Instead, they had Will Young, the very first winner of Pop Idol, performing his song "Leave Right Now" to
a montage of clips.

My wife and I watched every show of this American Idol season and thoroughly enjoyed it. Any
series with so many live performanc es, especially from people who have never been in front of a
camera before, will have its pitfalls, and the vultures will be there to gobble them up. There aren'tmany live shows on TV where so much has to come together. One thing I immensely enjoyed washow they followed the story lines of each contestent .
I also disagree with Michael and agree with Mira about the finale. There were a couple dudmoments, but overall it was fantastic. I enjoyed seeing some of the artists that I grew up with

163 Fansperform once again, but there was also something for all ages. Crystal is just amazing. I'm from the
Chicago area and was pulling for Lee until Tuesday night. I think the main reason why he won isbecause the Chicago media has whooped it up for him so much in the past few weeks and all thosevotes from the large Chicago metro area were too much for small-town Crystal to overcome. I can'twait to hear her first album.
Gonna disagree with you, Michael. I thought it was a pretty great finale. Took it personally as a
great send off for Simon on his last season. That's what the night was really all about for me andprobably a lot of other fans. Crystal or Lee winning/lo sing was a very distant second. 
For once, I thought the usually thick-as-a -plank AI producers did a pretty good job getting it all
together. Some great acts and they did very, very well, considerin g some of those folks are getting
pretty far along, age-wise. You don't really expect them to pop up looking/so unding like they did 30
years ago, did you? Bee Gees were great and a great quartet with Siobhan and Alex. The weakest ones, jmho, were Chicago. OUCH! Fun to see Alice Cooper! He sounded ok. JoeCocker! Awesome! (He's gettin' on, too.) Janet did fine. Christina Aguilera! LOVED what I guess isher new single off the new album, "You Lost Me". Looking forward to that release. 
Whatever. Paula was back! Simon was so obviously pleased to see her. He gave great farewell
speech. We all had fun. It's over. On to X Factor U.S. Fall 2011!!!!! YAY! 
Good luck and God Speed, Simey! We hardly knew ye... 
:-)
I've seen Alice Cooper in concert 5 of the last 7 years and his concerts rock! He is still
releasing albums and touring nearly every year. If you get a chance, check one of hisshows out.
Haha! I've never seen him perform "live", but we've run into him at Costco up inPhoenix a couple of times and my husband has run into him several times playinggolf at the Biltmore. He's a very pleasant man. Very sweet wife. My husband hasclearer memories of the "back-in-t he-day" stuff. He's older. I do enjoy his music
and performanc es myself, tho. :-)
Thanks for commenting . You're certainly right that it was all about Simon. But plenty of
classic acts sound great and not woozy, so no excuses for the ones that did, in my book.
Hah! Ok, fine, Michael, but I DID enjoy the Gibbs a lot more than Chicago, altho',after a second viewing they did sound a little better than I originally thought.Neener, neener... :-)
BTW, are you going to be covering X Factor U.S. when it gets here?FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POST

 FollowJanet Jackson was AMAZING and was captivatin g last night. Not quite sure what you were
watching. She did sound like Michael, and with the new haircut, looked like him too. But I couldn't
take my eyes off the screen the entire time she was on stage. She was the one and only performerthat had any impact, not to mention she looked absolutely FIERCE, and bless her, she wasamazing.
Yeah, loved seeing her. Really great performanc es!
And Janet definitely got the loudest applause from the audience in the arena. So you're notalone.
I love Crystal and think her voice (and her in general) is amazing. And that is why I am really gladthat she DIDN'T win last night. Now she won't be forced into doing an album that the AI producerswant her to do and she can do things her way. Winning AI has become a curse, other than KellyClarkson and Carrie Underwood non of the winners had any real success beyond maybe one song.Jennifer Hudsen, Clay Aiken and Chris Daughtry didn't win and I bet right now they are glad aboutthat.
Actually, if she is signed, and I'm pretty sure she will be, she will also be signing thru one ofFuller's companies and they WILL be guiding her along, as with any other Idol contestant .
Having said that, I'm sure they will try to give her as much leeway as possible so as to notinterfer with who she is as an artist.
You're right darc1818 AND miramcB. Crystal will be signed by Fuller. But because
she's not the winner, she won't be rushed out as quickly and may very well have a
better chance at taking a deep breath and doing it right. Though for most Idolwinners (except Carrie) it's the second album where they come into their own orflounder.
I feel like I have just been given an amazing gift. I have just had about 60 hours a year of my lifethat I would have spent watching future season of AI returned to me. Of course, that can't give mePermalink  | Share it

163 Fansback the 60 hours that was stolen this year. Actually, I exaggerate . I gave up watching the results
shows and just checking on line. 
The only bright thing about this season for me was Crystal. And after she obliterate d Lee in the
final, I was cautiously optimistic that maybe, just maybe, season 9 could be redeemed if the voting
public made the right decision and showed us the title actually still means something.
Lee is a nice enough guy, but watching him and Crystal in the finale - no longer in competitio n -
just went further to prove that Crystal is in a different league. She rocked out with Alanis while Leefizzled with Chicago (admittedl y, the shows producers must be to blame for the WORST guest duet
performanc e choice ever), and when Crystal and Lee were finally side by side (and then with Joe
Cocker) it was blatantly obvious who owned the show. Some people are calling audio fail, but I'mstill thinking Lee even forgot to sing one of his lines.Anyway, I really did think I was going to be pleasantly surprised. And so was utterly speechlesswhen Lee was announced the winner. 
Jumped the shark? Jumped the whole aquarium more like.
Oh, please, they stole nothing from you. If you continued to tune in, you freely gave them
your time. It's so tedious to hear people complain about lost time when they keep tuning in,and keep tuning in, and keep tuning in.
And yes, Crystal was great last night. And Lee was overwhelme d by the talant of Cocker
and Bowersox during that performanc e. He just didn't seem to be in the moment at all with
that one. And Crystal clearly understood WHO she was singing with, and seemed to enjoy
it and appreciate it.
Yeah, LOL! I agree with you on all counts. I don't think Lee must have had muchexposure to the likes of Joe during his younger years. Hey, too bad, but that's ok, I
guess. I did appreciate Crystal's obvious appreciati on, tho.
:-)
There is a certain relief when you cut a TV show loose. I remember doing that with ER
after six seasons, only to discover my children had grown up and started walking andtalking and were in school. It was nice to get to know them. But you'll lose those 60 hoursagain in the fall of 2011 when The X Factor starts!
Crystal got robbed. The teeny-bopp er tweener girls again proved it's nothing more than a pre-
pubesc ent popularity contest.
Lee is not nearly the same caliber as Crystal. Lee has zero personalit y... never said one funny or
clever thing all season -- just had a dopey aww shucks look...Crystal was solid from day one, + had many amazing moments. Lee had a few decent weeks
towards the end, but blew the final show + was nowhere near Crystal's league - she's the true artist
of the two. Either rigged or ignorant voting -- I'm done with this show, esp. w/no Simon. Lee willfade into obscurity in a few years.*Crystal, quite simply, is the better singer -- she will be around decades from now.Permalink  | Share it

59 FansNaw. I think it was just a very, very close race. Two pretty evenly matched contestant s and
the vagaries of audience taste and voting. Who knows? Maybe some Crystal fans thought
she was safe and didn't vote when they should have? Anyway, as you say, with no Simon,it's pretty much history now anyway. Crystal will do fine.
It wasn't close....j ust look at Dial Idol.
Lee won b/c he has a Y chromosome .
Girl's can't win this show anymore even when they are VASTLY superior.

Two pretty evenly matched contestant s? Really??
Anybody that really understand s music knows that you can go to a downtown bar
in any big city and see dozens of guys who sing and perform as well, if not betterthan Lee. Lee is nothing special. AI is not based on talent..it 's a teeny bopper,
popularity contest. If it's based on talent, then AI and its fans have gotten thewinner wrong for at least the past two years now.
CRYSTAL CLEAR- LEE DEWYZE IS THE NEW AMERICAN IDOL!
I think you mean the Worst American Idol ever.
HA HA HA HA !
With only 2% separating them to get into the finals and neither one ever appearing in thebottom three, it was always much closer than outsiders like me believed. The same mayhave been true for Adam Lambert and Kris Allen. I think next season the show would be
smarter to mention tight voting more often so people know it's a horse race. Carrie
apparently won by a massive margin every week. But if Lee and Crystal were neck andneck, they should have let us know weeks ago to create more suspense and keep peopleengaged. It could change the results, too.Permalink  | Share it

6 FansMichael I don't think it was very close the last two shows of the season. For the
overall season it might have been close, but Lee definitely went ahead the last twoshows.
And by went ahead, I meant by votes not by performanc e lol.
I agree that this was not the most exciting season but from the start it was easy to see that Crystal,
just like Adam Lambert, was the most talented of the group. OK, there is noone that compares toAdam. Lee may win since most of the people that vote are 12 - 17 years old, and they are lookingfor the cute guy and not the talent. Crystal reminds me of the musicians in the 60's which will notgo well with kids these days. I do hope Crystal will win.
Crystal won the night. I think Lee will win the title.
Boring night. I sure hope show is better Wednesday night.
You nailed it.
Meh. Thus far, it has been a tepid season and last night was a very tepid Final. Not a huge fan of
either of these contestant s. They are just ok. Best of the worst for this year. I think they are pretty
evenly matched. Lee's performanc es weren't that much off from Crystal's, particular ly in the first two
songs. I think the judges threw ole Lee under the bus, jmho. But, hey! Gotta be a winner, right? 
Chances are slim I would buy either CD/downloa d. Just not wowed by any of it, altho' the Falling
Slowly duet was pretty good.One thing I don't care for is allowing contestant s to sing songs they've already performed on the
show. Boring and annoying. It's the Final, for pete's sake. Do something NEW. Bottom line with these two: Haven't seen anything new from either of them for weeks. Felt like
leftover meatloaf to me.progressivewithaP    05:44 PM on 5/28/2010

575 FansI agree. Repeats are a huge turn off. I'd rather hear one of their originals.
Just hope they sneak Bonnie Raitt into the show tonight so Crystal and Bonnie can sizzle on
"Something to Talk About" as they announce their world tour! 
This deal was over months ago....: )
For what it's worth, Dial Idol says Lee will win. 
As a fan of Lee's, I have to say that Lee just seemed really nervous and Crystal performed much
better last night. 
However, I don't think Crystal needs the Idol crown to make her mark in the industry. Folks who like
her and her music will support her career regardless of whether she wins tonight. Lee, on the otherhand, would probably be helped by winning the Idol crown.
Lee won with the right crowd last week and it has carried him through to the title. I love it that
Crystal drove the bus over him on the way out though. She was pretty amazing. He played not tolose last night and it showed. Idol has never been more than a popularity contest occasional ly
impacted by talent. Not at all fair but we should be used to that by now.
Nice!!
If it goes like last year, the person with the raves will not win.
