most revolutionary
tihn of rhe yeu - ir s0 oGRE lT:
Director Cory Edwards
knows one of the most stun-
ning facts about the movie is
its hudget And not becausc
it's a wallct-buster Iike the
$200 rniliion "Kirg Kong."
"'tloodwinked' cost $15
million lo $20 nrillion, and
that's eraggeratilg just a lit-
tle bit bccause peoplc lvould-
n't really believe the real dol-

t'ho createcl and co-directed
the film with his brother
fodd Edwards ancl tliend
Tonv Leech. "l don't think
anyone hls cver macle a CGI

It's not as visually strrmiJlB
as "Shrck," "We llready

laughing ahour somc o[ the
comments he's seen onlinc.

"Hoodwinked" doesn't need
flash: lt's got fmy.
Many animated films have
cost $100 million ard more.
But 2002's $60 nillion "Icc
Age" caused a stir when it
grossed $375 million Other
hits, the crudely drawn
"South Park" md "Beavis and
Butthead," proved you don't
need lavish mimation to
score laughs But "Hood-
winked" sign.ificantly raises
- or, rather, lowers - thc
bu. Five years ago, it couldl't
have been made so cheaply.
Five yers from now it'll be
harder to tell movies like it

a lot of them are right

Want further proof? A
"Hoodwinked" sequel is
