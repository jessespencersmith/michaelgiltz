The Constant 
Gardener 
"',,,, * 'I, 
Universal, $2_9_.9_8 __ _ 
THIS thriller ahout evil 
pharmaceutic<11 companies 
proves director Fernando 
Meirelles (n("City of God") is 
no one-hit wonder. Similarly, 
R:1chel Weisz is sexily 
committed to the Cause of 
Justice. But the show belongs to 
Ralph Flennes, who does his 
best work in years as a ditIident 
diplomat radicalized by his wife. 
Dead Poets Society 
,:1;** 
Touc:~~~ _~ $19.99 
NOMINALLY a Robin Williams 
vehicle -he even got an Oscar 
nomination -this story of an 
inspiring teacher at a boys 
school really belongs to the 
students, especially Ethan 
Hawke as a stutterer and Robert 
Sean Leonard ~IS the romantic 
figure crushed down bv his 
overbearing father (Ku'rtwood 
Smith). Maybe that's why 
Williams couldn't be bothered to 
contribute to the e:...tras. 
including a making-of. faw lakes. 
and audio commentary. 
Hustle & Flow

Par~ ~unt, $29,95 
TERRENCE Howard is 
memorable as a pimp turned 
would-be r:1ppcr. So why do 
viewers mostly remember his 
stable of girls' Paula Jai Parker 
is great as a pushy whore. 
Taraji P. Henson is delightful 
as Shug, moved beyond words 
when she hears her own 
sing,iog. And Taryn Manning is 
ternflc as Nola, desperate to 
be useful at something, Extras 
include commentary (rom 
writer/ directOl Craig Brewer, 
Also out: !ngmar Bergman's

BILL Murray is pretty hard to 
resist in this low-key charmer

All in the Family, Fifth 
Season 
*'** " sony, $29,9~ __ 
CLASSIC TV is always timely, 
How dse to explain tire 
coincidence that this season 
be~ins with four episodes of 
Aldlie ;:md his union going on 
strike' (It doesn't end well for 
him,) This is also the season 
where the Jeffersons left for 
their own spin-off. so it's all 
d,)wllhill from here, No extras 
and the picture quality is SO-~O, 
hut the show is still a champ. 
Also out: TV's gentlest host gets 
his due with "Tlte Merv Griffin 
Sh,)\\: 40 of the Most Interesting; 
People of All Time" (Alpha; 
$29.98); tine singing in "The 
Cospel" (Sony; $28.95); ami an 
even dumber version of "Dumb 
& Dumber Unrated Edition" 
(New Line: $19.98). 10BEST

1 The Harold Lloyd 
Comedy Collection 
New Line,,189,98 
A comic legend always 
mentioned in the same 
breath with Chaplin and 
KeatofL No\\" we kuow why. 
Dozens of fi I m~ and sbort s 
barely leave you enough 
time to check Ollt Lloyd s 
personal 3-D pllOtoS (glasses 
included), 
1. The Incredibles 
~is~~y ,g9,99 ._ . ____ _ 
A real gem, and one movie 
you won't mind the kids 
playing nver and over again. 
The delightful Oscar­
nominated short "Bound in' " 
is the prize among the many 
extras. 
3 King Kong 
~arnE!rJi39,98 
One of the last major 
movies to fill;llly make its 
DVD debut. the 1933 classic 
does it in style, thanks to 
super-fan Peter Jackson. 
Jackson's making-of 
docurnentary is an 
astonishing 2 hours and 40 
minutes long -and utterlv 
fascinating . ' 
4 Ran 
Criterion, $39,95 _ 
As always. virtually 
everything from Criterion is 
essential, but special kudos 
for making this Akira 
Kurosawa masterpiece look 
better than ever. Director 
Chris Marker's 74-minute 
documentary "A.K." is 
worthy of the master. 
5 Gallipoli: 
Special Edition 
Paramount, $14,~ 
An anti-war masterpiece 
breaks your heart thanks to 
director Peter Weir and Mel 
GibsOll_ The documentary 
"Entrenched: The Making
