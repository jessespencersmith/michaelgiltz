t was the Wild ard night of perf or­
mances on Fox TV's Amel"ican 
ldo~ and 23-year-old Mal'Clu Lynche 
was standing in front of U1 judg . 
In a new lwist. a dozen handpi k d 
semifinalists who hadn't yet made it to 
the final 12 were told to practice all 
week, but they wouldn't find out until 
the live broadcast whether they'd get a 
chance to sing for their one last shot 
The judges took turns handing out 
the verdict, and Lynche-Iooking hand­
some and confident and very Fame with 
his sleeveless vest, stud earrings, dan­
gling CruCifIX, and dancer's body-was televisioD 
America's favorite reality TV 
contest may be cutting 
contestants who appear 
"too gay" By Michael Giltz 
facing the tart-tongued Simon Cowell. 
"Marque, we brought you back be­
cause we all think you are a good singer," 
Cowell said as more than 24 million 
viewers watched. "However , we think 
you are more of a stage singer. Therefore 
you will not be on the show tonight" 
THE ADVOCATE 1781 MAY 11, 2004 Lynche's mouth dropped open. "Are 
you serious?" he asked. "Sorry," said 
Cowell. Lynche walked off the stage in a 
haze, never to be seen again. 
What happened? Why would some­
one who all the judges agree has a good 
voice not be allowed to sing? 
Fox declined to put The Advocate in 
touch with Lynche, but some believe he 
was penalized for not seeming hetero 
enough. Lynche has a real theater back­
ground-he joined the cast of the stage 
musical Fame on 42nd St. on April 
13-but many Idol watchers believe 
that when the judges say someone is</p>
<p>"too Broadway ," what they're really say­
ing is "You seem gay." Carla Hay of BiU­
board is one such observer. 
"For people who don't know the [gay] 
culture, that comment may go over their 
heads," says Hay, who covers TV for the 
music industry bible. "But from my 
pOint of view, that's basically what 
Simon is saying. Anyone he deems 'too 
Broadway' is someone he feels is too ef­
feminate. And he only says it about male 
singers. He didn't say that for Frenchie 
Davis, who has been to Broadway. " 
Contestants who read as gay have be­
come scarce in the current third sea­
son-although that's an admittedly sub­
jective observation, since only one 
contestant so far, season 1 finalist Jim 
Verraros, has come out. "When I first au­
ditioned, there were so many, so many 
gay guys in the top 30," says Verraros, 
who begins a tour of gay clubs in May 
and stars in the new gay film festival fa­
vorite Eating Out. "We were definitely 
the most sexually diverse. Absolutely ." 
Since Verraros's departur e, the only 
inarguably gay content on Idol has come 
from the mock gay-baiting between the superstraight Cowell and host Ryan 
Seacrest , who happily embraces his 
metrosexuality but says he isn't gay-or 
from kidding contestants like footballer 
Matthew Rogers, who sang to Cowell 
after he was voted off on March 24. 
Hay notes that this season also seems 
"less gay" because women contestants 
are dominating and the judges rarely sin­
gle out women as "too Broadway." In­
stead, suspender-clad final-32 contestant 
Briana Ramirez-Rial (also unavailable to 
The Advocate) got the equivalent of an 
antilesbian slam when she was deemed 
too "angry" before getting cut. Was she 
not feminine enough? "She looked very 
butch," Hay agrees. 
The judges' gender standards may be 
enforced even in preliminaries. An 
openly gay Idol hopeful named David, 
who sang for an anonymous screening 
panel at Houston's Minute Maid Park, 
recalls that he was told "I had an amaz­
ing voice and was very talented-but I 
needed to work on my 'marketability. '" 
Leaving the stadium, he says, "I sulked 
down the dark hallway pondering 
what 'marketability ' could be, exactly." Would viewers care whether an Idol 
favorite was gay? British fans don't Will 
Young, the first winner of the original 
Pop Idol, revealed that he's gay immedi­
ately after his victory and has since re­
leased two hit albums. Another u.K. tal­
ent show, Fame Academy, was won by 
"baby dyke" Alex Parks. No, it's not 
viewers who would mind, Hay says, "it's 
the record labels." Many fans, on the 
other hand, "would find Britney Spears 
portraying a Lolita when she was under­
age more offensive than if Clay Aiken 
was openly gay." 
Aiken has said emphatically that he's 
straight-and The Advocate has no in­
formation about Lynch's or Ramirez­
Rial's orientation-but Hay speculates 
that even the teenage Claymates proba­
bly wouldn't mind a gay Idol. "Kids now 
are more open-minded than their par­
ents or grandparents," she says. "If Clay 
were gay and came out of the closet, I 
don't think that would hurt his record 
sales." But we may never know .•
