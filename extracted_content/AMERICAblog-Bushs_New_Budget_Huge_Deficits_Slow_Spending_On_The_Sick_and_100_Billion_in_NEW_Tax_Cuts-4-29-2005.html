4/29/2005 01:57:00 AMIn what was mostly a party line vote, the House and Senateapproved a new budget that slowed spending on Medicaid(without tackling that problem in any real way), acceptedmassive deficits as par for the course, approved $106 billion innew tax cuts for the wealthy and, of course, gave the thumbsup to drilling in Alaska because if we drill in Alaska, there's noreason to push our faltering falling-behind car companies --which are about two minutes away from begging for handoutslike the airlines -- into improving gas mileage, god forbid.
