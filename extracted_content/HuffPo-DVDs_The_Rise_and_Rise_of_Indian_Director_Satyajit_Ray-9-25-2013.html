            <p>DVDs: The Rise and Rise of IndianDirector Satyajit Ray
Here's a roundup of great recent releases from Criterion , the premiere label for
reissues of classic cinema. It goes without saying that anything released by Criterion
is worth renting and/or buying for any serious movie fan.
CHARULATA  ($39.99 BluRay; Criterion)
THE BIG CITY  ($39.99 BluRay; Criterion) -- Satyajit Ray is one of the giants of
cinema. Everyone knows this -- he garnered countless awards during a career that
included dozens of films, documentaries and shorts. His debut film -- Pather Panchali-- and the Apu Trilogy often appear on lists of the best films of all time. At one point,Pather Panchali  ranked in the Top Ten on the famed Sight + Sound poll of critics
worldwide . In the most recent poll, it ranked at #41 and Ray's The Music Room  was at
#183 and The World Of Apu  at #235. Three movies on the extended list of 250 films?
Any filmmaker would be proud of such enduring recognition.
And yet...India's Ray is held in high regard but his movies have been slipping in those
polls and slipping in the popular consciousness of movie buffs. There's one simple
reason: they haven't been able to watch his movies. (It's the same reason Abel
Gance's Napoleon  has slipped in visibility; it's too difficult to show that behemoth in
the proper fashion.) Even the beloved Pather Panchali  -- a delightful film that can be
embraced by audiences with ease (it's not just for cineastes) -- is hard to see. I'vegone to august locations like Lincoln Center to watch the Apu Trilogy and been forcedto see scratchy old prints. The DVDs of his movies were mostly subpar. This is hardlyunusual; even a director as commercially popular as Alfred Hitchcock can see hismovies fall into disrepair. Rear Window  needed a full restoration and if that does
despite the highly commercial nature of the film and the fact that studios can easilymake money off of it, then any movie can fall through the cracks.
So Ray is a giant of cinema, acclaimed throughout the world even 21 years after his
death but his movies simply haven't been seen much and rarely in the great printsthey deserve. Now, finally, that's changing. A major restoration of Ray's body of workhas been underway for years. The British Film Institute is hosting a retrospective ofhis work  taking advantage of these new, fully restored prints. That retrospective will
surely travel the globe. And now Criterion is releasing BluRays of key works. Wisely,
they're starting with movies other than the Apu Trilogy since most reviews would start
and end with that landmark work. Pather Panchali and the other two are indeedclassics, but Ray's body of work is far, far richer than just those three films.
Criterion begins with Ray's personal favorite film Charulata , a tale in the 1800s of a
woman drawn to her husband's poetry-spouting cousin. Ray always said this film was
closest to the vision he had in his head for it, The other movie is also female-May 14, 2014

<p>centered. It's The Big City, a drama about a wife who breaks tradition to take a job
and finds she's damn good at it. Both challenge conventional Indian attitudes towards
the role of women. Both sets include thoughtful extras that add to your knowledge ofthese films in particular and Ray in general. Here's a trailer for The Big City; note -- itdoes NOT look as good as the restoration.
But what do these BluRays look  like? Despite a lifetime of admiration, I've never seen
a good print of Pather Panchali.  What would these less well known films look like? I
trust Criterion but they're only as good as their source material. I popped in Charulata ,
held my breath...and was astonished. These restorations are impeccable, beautiful,striking. The genius of Ray and how gorgeous his movies are came through withastonishing power. The Big City?  Just as good. The details were vivid and sharp. I
feel like I'm truly seeing Ray's work for the very first time. (Criterion also has a greatBluRay of The Music Room  available on BluRay.)
So it won't be a reappraisal of Satyajit Ray, exactly. We've known for a long time how
important he is as a talent. But it's a reemergence of his body of work and a new
appreciation for the breadth of his accomplishment, one that should keep him right up
there with world masters like Ozu and Kurosawa and Bergman and others. If peoplecan't see your movies they can hardly cherish them. And soon, in the next year or twowe'll finally have a terrific boxed set of The Apu Trilogy in a glorious restored version.With the renewed attention this will bring, expect Ray's stock to rise higher and higherin the years to come back to where he belongs -- on everyone's short list of cinematicgiants.
THE EARRINGS OF MADAME DE...  ($39.95
BluRay; Criterion) -- In some ways, themovies of director Max Ophuls suffered thesame fate as Ray's. For various complicatedfamilial reasons, it's been said that his son(the legendary documentary filmmakerMarcel Ophuls) didn't allow the films of hisfather to enjoy wide circulation. That'schanged in recent years and his ravishing
work is being savored again. Most would
agree that The Earrings Of Madame de...  is
the first among a handful of his best, that also
includes Le Plaisir, Letter From An Unknown
Woman  and The Reckless Moment . Earrings
-- the sophisticated tale of an aristocraticwoman who sells off a piece of jewelry to paya debt with tragic unforeseen consequences-- is so beautifully acted and dazzlingly shotthat even a neophyte knows they're in thepresence of greatness. It's never lookedbetter, either.</p>
<p>BABETTE'S FEAST  ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion) -- I've had a grudge with Babette's
Feast  for years. The movie is thoroughly delightful but when it won the Oscar for Best
Foreign Film, it beat out Louis Malle's Au Revoir, Les Enfants.  Both were on my list of
the best films of 1987, but for me Au Revoir  is a piercingly great film. That's unfair of
course. It's not the fault of Babette's Feast  that it's a crowd pleaser, that it proved a hit
at the box office, that the elaborate meal at the heart of the film was so enticing that
theaters created package deals where you could see the film and then partake of ameal like the one shown in the film. Based on a short story by Isak Dinesen, it's thecharming tale of a French housekeeper stranded in a dour little village in Denmark inthe late 1800s. She asks one favor: to prepare them a "proper" French meal and thevillagers find their religious fear of pleasure sorely tried by the brilliant feast thatBabette prepares. It's a delight. I must say that a 1995 documentary about Dinesenaka Karen Blixen and an interview with a sociologist about cuisine and French culturewere very subpar by Criterion's standards. But if you're like me and care 99% aboutthe movie and 1% about the extras, rest assured that the film itself looks great.
SAFETY LAST!  ($39.95 BluRay; Criterion) --
As long as people watch movies, they'll keeprediscovering and laughing along with theworks of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton andHarold Lloyd. Safety Last!  is surely the
perfect introduction to his talent, whichcombines smart comedy with breathtakingstunts. Seeing Lloyd climb up the side of abuilding and then hang from the hands of agiant clock -- well, fearless and foolhardydon't begin to cover the emotions raised by
this bit of derring-do. It happened 90 years
ago and is still more exciting than most actionscenes you'll see today. It's the highpoint of atale about a lowly clerk in a department storewho has big dreams about rising up thecorporate ladder. Most people climb up theladder on the inside  of an office building, but
whatever works! The excellent extras includethree more shorts, commentary anddocumentaries including Harold Lloyd: TheThird Genius,  a film made for the American</p>
<p>Masters series that fueled interest in his work. Just watch the trailer and you'll see so
many good gags you'll just have to see the entire film.
THE LIFE OF OHARU  ($39.95 BluRay;
Criterion) --
Once upon a time, Japanese cinema to
Westerners began and ended with Akira
Kurosawa. Those days are long past. In fact,
it's time for Kurosawa to regain supremacy
after a backlash when some discovered he
was too "Western" for Japanese critics andpulled away a bit from his films in favor ofmore "authentic" Japanese films.Nonetheless, it's been a welcomedevelopment that we have a much broaderappreciation for the breadth and depth ofJapanese cinema, from giants like Ozu to thegreat B movies that emulated our noir andgangster flicks with their own wacky flair.Surely one of the best discoveries is KenjiMizoguchi, a legend alongside Ozu andKurosawa. Shockingly, he died at 58 yearsold. It's shocking because he left such a rich
body of work (some 70 plus films). Among his greats are Sansho The Bailiff, Ugetsu,The Story Of The Last Chrysanthemums  and The Life Of Oharu.  This movie propelled
his post-war career and worldwide fame, thanks in part to a marvelous central
performance by Kinuyo Tanaka as a lady-in-waiting at court who falls inexorably lower
and lower until she's nothing but a street prostitute. For me, the movie is a soap and
nothing but a catalog of woe. One disaster after another strikes Oharu and I found it
repetitive. Don't get me wrong. It's a good movie, just not a great one. I much prefer
others of his works. But it's extremely popular and Tanaka is great. Among the extrasis a documentary about Tanaka going to Hollywood on a goodwill tour where shemeets Bette Davis, gives her a kimono and generally does the rounds back when aJapanese movie star was an exotic idea to Westerners indeed. Here's a clip from thedocumentary extra below.
