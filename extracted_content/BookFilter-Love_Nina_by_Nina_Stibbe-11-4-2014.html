From the Publisher: "Breezy, sophisticated, hilarious, rude and aching
with sweetness: LOVE, NINA might be the most charming book I've ever
read." --Maria Semple, author of Where'd You Go, Bernadette
In 1982, 20-year-old Nina Stibbe moved to London to work as a nanny to
two opinionated and lively young boys. In frequent letters home to her
sister, Nina described her trials and triumphs: there's a cat nobody likes,
suppertime visits from a famous local playwright, a mysteriously unpaidmilk bill, and repeated misadventures parking the family car. Dinner tablediscussions cover the gamut, from the greats of English literature, toswearing in German, to sexually transmitted diseases. There's no end to
what Nina can learn from these boys (rude words) and their broad-minded
mother (the who's who of literary London).
A charming, hilarious, sweetly…

What We Say
Love, Nina by Nina Stibbe is a charming memoir presented as a series of letters between Stibbe and her sister. Stibbe
worked as a nanny for the female head of the London Review of Books in the 1980s, allowing her to weigh in on everyonefrom her boss’s ex-husband, film director Stephen Frears, to various and sundry figures, from a decidedly humorous and
domestic perspective. It’s a delight, mostly centered on family. But the real catnip for theater lovers is next-door neighbor
Alan Bennett, who Stibbe first thinks might be an actor on the telly but finally susses out is a playwright. Bennett
encourages her to go back to school when not obliquely criticizing her cooking (he’s often over for dinner), and it’s a most

What Others Say
"I adored this book, and I could quote from it forever. It's real, odd, life-affirming, sharp, loving...and I can't
remember the last time I laughed out loud so frequently while reading."â Nick Hornby , The Believer  - 
"[Love, Nina  is] observant, funny, terse, at times a bit rude. It affords a glimpse into a rarefied London social
and literary milieu...These letters are winning from the start...we simply like being in Ms. Stibbe's
company."â Dwight Garner, The New York Times  - 
"I have never laughed so hard reading a book. Nina Stibbe's recollections of life as a London nanny are both
hilarious and heartwarming."â J. Courtney Sullivan, author of Maine  and The Engagements  - 
"I must MOST EARNESTLY recommend Love, Nina  by Nina Stibbe. It's the most piss-funny thing I've read all year. I
can't remember a book since Adrian Mole that so brilliantly, drily nailed day-to-day life in BRILLIANT, faux-naive
prose."â Caitlin Moran, author of How to Build a Girl  - 
"Nina Stibbe is the funniest new writer…
