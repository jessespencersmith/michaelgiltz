7/11/2005 04:30:00 AMWe've already talked about some of the many, many waysBush has weakened our military, left our borders vulnerableand simply refused to take the common sense, essential stepsneeded to make America safer and more secure.Here's another infuriating way Bush has let our troops -- andtherefore our country -- down. Our crumbling, delapidatedVeterans Administration hospitals.The Washington Post focuses on one hospital to tell the story ofBush's incompetence on the care of veterans. That hospital justhappens to contain one of the best PTSD (Post TraumaticStress Disorder) Units in the country, one ideal for helpingveterans cope with their injuries and a return to civilian life.250,000 new veterans entered the VA system in 2004, withalmost half of them coming from Iraq. Bush couldn't haveguessed this would happen? Here's the result of hisnegligience.According to documents released at recent meetings of theHouse and Senate Veterans Affairs committees, the VAhospital in White River Junction, Vt., was forced to shutits operating rooms temporarily because of a lack ofmaintenance funds to repair a broken heating, ventilationand air conditioning system. Hospitals in Arkansas,Oklahoma, Mississippi, Louisiana and eastern Texasstopped scheduling appointments for many veterans.The VA medical center in San Diego, with a waiting list of750 veterans, diverted $3.5 million in maintenance fundsto partially cover operating expenses and delayed filling 131vacancies for three months to cover operating expenses.The Portland, Ore., hospital delayed non-emergencysurgery for at least six months, and 7,000 veterans whouse the VA facility in Bay Pines, Fla., are waiting longer than30 days for a primary care appointment.He's not just screwing over soldiers who fought in Iraq. He's screwingover the veterans of Vietnam, Korea and World War II to boot. Bushtries to cut hazardous pay to soldiers fighting overseas, plays gameswith the VA budget by pretending there won't be a massive influx ofwounded kids that will need intensive care, and abuses the NationalGuard and Reserves. How can he even pretend to support the troops?
