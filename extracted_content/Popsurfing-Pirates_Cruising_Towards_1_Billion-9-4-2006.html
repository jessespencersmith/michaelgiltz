            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  S E P T E M B E R  0 4 ,  2 0 0 6"Pirates" Cruising Towards $1 Billion"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" has grossed $579.1 miloverseas and $991.9 million worldwide. By next weekend, it will havejoined "Titantic" ($1.85 billion) and "The Lord of the Rings: The Returnof the King" ($1.12 billion) as only the third film in history to gross $1billion worldwide at the box office. Then of course it will gross aMINIMUM of $500 million on DVD worldwide (that is a VERYconservative figure). And then there's next summer's sequel, which willpresumably gross another $1 billion or more at the movies and onDVD. So you're looking at a trilogy of films that will easily top $3billion. And it all rests squarely on the shoulders of Johnny Depp. Nowall we ever hear is how movie stars are ridiculously overpaid. So exactlyhow much would Depp have to be paid for these movies before wecould accuse him of being overpaid? $200 million? $300 million? Thatstill leaves $2.7 BILLION for the studio. So tell me again howsuperstars in blockbusters are killing the industry.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
