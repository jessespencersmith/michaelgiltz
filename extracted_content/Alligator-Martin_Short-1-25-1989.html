It used to be so simple. Movie. 
stars sometimes spent their wan­
ing years on television (see also, 
"Rock Hudson"), TV stars were always considered too small to fill 
up the big screen and never the 
twain would meet. 
But John . Travolta and Saturday 
Night Live changed all that. Now­
adays, TV stars appear on the sil­
ver screen, movie stars would kill 
Ito get their own weekly series and 
V they'd all love to develop a cable 
special for that cute little idea 
their cousin in Reno had. . 
The rules changed just in time 
for Martin Short. His new film, 
Three Fugitives, opens Friday, 
marking the latest chapter in a convoluted career that could only 
occur in the 'BOs. 
Short has gone from -take a 
deep breath -network television 
(The Associates) to syndicated TV 
(SCTV Comedy Network) to late 
night comedy (Saturday Night 
Live) to the movies (Innerspace, 
Three Amigos) to Saturday morn­
ing cartoons (The Completely Men­
tal Misadventures of Ed Grimley) to 
cable specials (Martin Short's Hol­
lywood) and, presumably, back to 
the movies. 
Obviously, while some make the 
jump to the big screen and never 
look back, Short isn't one of them. 
"1 think the mistake that some 
people going from television to 
film make is that they don't real­
ize how great TV is and keep 
doing it," he explained in an in­
terview to promote his new 
movie. 
Called Three Fugitives, it pairs 
Short with Nick Nolte in a comedy 
about an inept bank robber (Short) 
who is stealing to pay for his 
daughter's medical bills. He acci­
dentally implicates a seasoned 
professional just released from jail 
(Nolte) and the two are thrown 
together as they flee the police. 
Directed by Francis (La Cage Aux 
Folies) Veber, it is a typical Touch­
stone comedy -low on convinc­
ing characters and high on broad, 
slapstick humor. 
Of course, slapstick humor is 
Martin Short's specialty. Prancing

ing. However, most children's Shakeslpe , .. tlItliiJlll 
shows are so bad that anything 
remotely intelligent would st~nd 
out. But Grimley is actually 'good . 
and Short is rightly proud of his 
work on it. 
In the beginning, though, he was 
less than pleased. "When I first 
saw the animation, I went,</p>
<p>nerspace, with Dennis Quaid. 
But it was years after he had 
entered the big time before Short 
learned his hardest lesson about 
the vagaries of Tinseltown . Cross 
My Heart marked his debut as a 
lead -and in a romantic role, no 
less. A mature comedy produced 
by Lawrence (The Big Chill) 
Kasdan, the movie was never 
given more than a token release by 
its studio. 
Short insists that he never ex­
pected any more. "I don't think 
one person involved in that film 
-(which was about) two people 
on a date talking about their rela­
tionship -expected it to be any 
more than it was, which was gen-erally well-reviewed and doing 
well in rental. 
"It's not a high-budget film," he 
said. "You don't expect Top Gun 
results." 
Commercial potential is the last 
thing on his mind when choosing 
a movie, Short said. NAIl I say is, 
'Who's directing it, who's in it, 
who's writing it, who's editing it?' 
"The whole thing is the experi­
ence," he continued . "The work that I do in these films In .. 'nl'J .... 
months of involvement, decislollS t 
and meetings. You work and grow 
as an actor; you experience

"And if you work as hard and 
intensely as you can, you're aIUl'flVjl~

got distributed correctly. ,UlU. _Ul­
!ice success) has nothing 
with it. You just have to let 
go or you'd go crazy."
