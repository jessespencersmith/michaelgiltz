            <p>S U N D AY,  J U LY  0 2 ,  2 0 0 6"Superman Returns" -- * * 1/2You'll truly believe a man can fly. That was the promise of 1978's"Superman" with Christopher Reeve -- great special effects. But in factthe movie offered something much more important -- great characters.When you believe in Clark Kent and Lois Lane, frankly it doesn't matterhow good the special effects are. (George Lucas forgot this years ago.)Now "Superman Returns" is enjoyable. And if you want to compare itto something, why not compare it to "Superman III" and "SupermanIV," by which standard it is terrific indeed. It doesn't suck. But why arethe first things that come to mind when praising it the special effects? Isimply loved the way this movie depicted flying -- it's graceful, gentle,inspiring. When Superman is trying to rescue an out of controlairplane, there's a moment when he pauses in mid-air and then throwshimself towards the damaged craft with all his might -- it catches yourbreath because it looks so real. Even better is the emotional highlight ofthe movie -- a gentle late-night flight with Lois Lane where Supermantries to explain why he went away for five years and what it's like forhim to spend every waking moment hearing cries for help from all overMetropolis and the world. What else springs to mind when thinkingabout the movie? The cool color of Superman's cape, the washed outpalette of much of the movie, the recycling of that brilliant originalscore. What doesn't come to mind so much? Clark Kent and Lois Lane.Brandon Routh makes a much better Superman than he does a ClarkKent. Clark makes almost no impression while Supe holds yourattention every time he talks to Lois (which isn't often enough). KateBosworth isn't as bad as I had heard as Lois, but unfortunately --except for that one late night flight -- she doesn't get along withSuperman and doesn't even seem terribly interested to see Clark afterhe's been away for years. So what are we left with? The secondarycharacters. Kevin Spacey has fun as Lex Luthor without going over thetop and Parker Posey has a few good moments as his sidekick. ButFrank Langella has nothing to do as Perry White. (Compare that to thegreat character of the newspaper editor in "Spiderman.") Think aboutit: Lois Lane is engaged to his nephew (James Marsden) and Perry issuddenly thrusting her back into the arms of Superman -- don't youthink that would create a little conflict for him? Jimmy Olsen is wastedtoo. Justin Whalin brought some verve to the role on TV's "Lois &Clark." And surely by now we can make something of the fact thatNext Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
