SHUTTERSTOCK
If the Oscars want to promote diversity, they should start with their
shorts. I don't mean diversity in gender or color or worldview. In fact, theshorts nominated for Live Action, Animation and Documentary are
invariably shorts that come from around the world and feature a virtual
rainbow of skin color, geographic perspective and (sometimes) womenbehind the camera as well as in front. So by that measure, the Academyshould be trumpeting their shorts more than ever.
But in terms of stylistic diversity, the shorts are depressingly alike. Year
after year, they are earnest, issue-oriented and just plain a downer. Theyare Oscar bait and Oscar keeps gobbling them up. The batch of liveOscar Shorts 2016: Would It Kill You to Lighten Up?</p>
<p>action and animated shorts I watched this year are no exception. Usually
one can expect the animated shorts to contain a few laughs, but not this
time around, not really. I hope in years to come they can rewardfilmmakers not for the issues they tackle or the timeliness of their topicsbut for the artistry they display.
Still, everyone knows if you want an edge on your Oscar ballot, the shorts
are a great place to dive in. Watch them and you often can make a prettygood guess as to which will win. At the very least you'll be informed. Theshorts play in movie theaters around the country, they can be seen on TV
on the cable channel 
Shorts: The Short Movie Channel  and you can buy
them online from many platforms.
ANIMATED SHORTS
Bear Story  -- For me, this wordless piece is the most satisfying work
visually. It combines various forms of animation and tells a rather sad
story within a story. A bear wakes up and gets to work: work, for him, isstanding on a street corner trying to entice people to part with a coin and
watch his wind-mechanical gizmo tell a story. That story turns out to be
the rather sad one of how the bear was abducted by evil men and forcedto work in a circus until he finally broke away and returned home in hopes
of finding his wife and child again. The animation is distinctive and top-
notch but the final resolution is actually a little confusing. Still, this is theone I admire the most. But be warned: show it to little ones and you willnever be able to take them to a traditional circus again.
Prologue  -- Easily the most perplexing short, this begins in live action with
a pair of hands shaving off colored pencils and then drawing the title card
"PROLOGUE" onto a piece of paper. Then we see a sketch of a flower
which becomes animated and a bee appears. It seems like a nature short</p>
<p>with rather lovely imagery...until a face looms up. Slowly we realize we're
seeing an ancient battle between warriors. It's violent, brutal and kind of
pointless, until the unintentionally hilarious climactic moment.Bewildering.
Sanjay's Super Team  -- A Pixar short, which means expectations are
immediately raised. It's a Bollywood flavored tale with a lot of heart,
showing a little boy enamored with his favorite TV show while the kid'sdad prepares for the daily rituals of his faith. The boy is dragooned intoparticipating and is clearly bored until he imagines his superheroes
combining with the deities on display in a thrilling showdown with a
villain. The visuals are strong and the story sweet, as one expects. It endsmodestly and the actual action is more confusing than anything but theperspective of another culture and the generally fine focus on
conventional storytelling make this satisfying.
We Can't Live Without Cosmos  -- This Russian short is also quite good
and light-hearted...for a while. It's about cosmonauts competing for the
chance to go into space. We spend our team with two men who make agreat team and after numerous amusing trials they make it to the top!
Their tale is well told with unexpected turns and some genuine drama.
But yet again, the elliptical finale is not satisfying: I remained uncertain asto their actual relationship. Were they childhood best friends, brothers, oreven perhaps lovers? One shouldn't be confused at such a fundamental
level and it makes the denouement a little less gratifying.
World Of Tomorrow  -- Easily the boldest short, this one takes welcome
visual risks as it shows a little girl being greeted by a visitor from the
future. It's a clone of herself, speaking in a slightly mechanical tone about
the world the little girl can expect to see. The future proves a bit of adisappointment, however, with repeated jokes about the sorry lot of
people without money, the flaws that pop up once you've cloned yourself
five or ten times and so on. Though admirably out there, this maintains arather flat tone and becomes too repetitive in style and substance.
Overall, it's always telling how much animation can tackle. It's a pity
feature length films are so often limited to fairy tales, pre-sold productsand indeed films suitable for kids. We've known for a long time animation
can be a vehicle for just about anything but sadly the only time we see
that proven in a movie theater is when we see shorts. I think Oscar votersare tired of supporting Pixar and think the melancholy of Bear Story  will
stick with them.
Oscar Winner: Bear Story.
LIVE ACTION SHORTS</p>
<p>Ave Maria  -- This is the would-be comedic short, using the backdrop of
tensions in Israel and the Gaza Strip to mine some laughs and of course
suggest we could all get along if we'd just work together, giggle a bit and
so on. A Jewish man, his wife and mother accidentally run into a statue ofthe Virgin Mary, decapitating it in the process. Their car is damaged andthey need to use a phone. The problem? The statue is in front of a
convent of nuns who've taken a vow of silence. The mother and
daughter-in-law bicker, the husband won't pick up a phone aftersundown and the nuns won't speak. Hilarity, however, does not ensue.It's a rather forced bit of whimsy with people acting annoyed at each
other for no good reason. (Everyone's pretty grumpy.) It has a visual gag
at the end, but this is hackneyed fare and easily the weakest of the five.
Day One  -- Like the three below it, this is a well-made, well-acted short of
high quality in technical terms. Here we watch the hellish first day of a
female interpreter joining a unit in Afghanistan. Needless to say,
everything that can happen does, from an explosion to a pregnant
woman to moments funny and awkward and moving. It's inspired by the
tour of duty of writer-director Henry Hughes. Unfortunately, in dramaticterms it feels manipulative in ways I can't describe without giving awaythe plot. We feel jerked around by the story, rather than caught up in
twists and turns.
Everything Will Be Okay  -- The most rock solid short, this shows a German
father picking up his little girl for a day at the fair. Clearly, he's a divorced
man reduced to the "every other weekend" relationship with his child. No
dummy, his little girl wraps daddy around her finger, turning a trip to a toystore from the promised one toy to two, both of them imposingly big. We
soon suspect he's planning to abduct and so does his child, whose face
creases in worry as they don't seem to be going where they should. Thisis a superior work with excellent performances all around, tension and aconclusion that is fully earned and quite moving, without resorting to
fireworks.
Shok  -- Set during the Kosovo war, it's reportedly based on a true story.
But being "true" does not guarantee being convincing. Two boys are best
friends despite the tense militarized world they live in, complete withoccupying troops and curfews. When one boy is doing some mysteriousdealings with the troops terrorizing their world, the other feels betrayed. A
precious bike becomes endangered, their friendship falters even more
and then each of them sacrifices for the other. But the movie pushes thiseven further with a hardly surprising tragic finale and a present-daydenouement. While the real-life incident is surely heartrending, making
such tragic moments play well on film is no easy task and not one Shok
accomplishes.</p>
<p>Stutterer  -- This should have been the winner. It's a pretty charming tale
of a young man who has a severe stutter. He's got an online romance
with a girl who we assume doesn't know about his speech defect and theboy is frightened naturally about meeting up in the real world. Over andover in his head he practices dialogue that in real life struggles to come
out. Eventually, he agrees to meet and they do only to discover.... Well,
I'm hardly going to ruin the ending. You spend the short imagining anumber of different scenarios, not to mention wondering why he just
doesn't warn her in advance. I'm assuming he hasn't told her. But in fact
the fatal weakness here is that the ending is rather bungled on severallevels. Even discussing it over with friends afterwards, we couldn't quiteagree on what happened or what was intended. It's a pity because this
short had a winning tone and easy charm that was vastly appealing after
the other shorts all so burdened by the issues of the day. I'll be sure tokeep an eye out for writer-director Benjamin Cleary (not to mention the
winning star, Matthew Needham) but can't in good conscience overlook
the flaws of the last scene.
It is a pity the live action shorts have such an Afterschool Special vibe to
their plot lines this year. I'm most intrigued to see what Cleary does next,
but the satisfaction of Everything Will Be Okay on every level gets myvote.
Oscar Winner: Everything Will Be Okay.
