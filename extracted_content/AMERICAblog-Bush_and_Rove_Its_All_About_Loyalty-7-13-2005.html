7/13/2005 10:54:00 AMThe New York Times has a lenghty feature on Bush and Roveand they spin it exactly the way Bush would love: it's all aboutloyalty.The NYT reminds us that Bush usually rewards people whoscrew up. It also goes into detail on the State of the Unionaddress that contained those 16 words -- also known as a lie --and details how Wilson was absolutely right and Bushultimately had to retract those words. What the NYT doesn't dois point out how this well-known incident means RNC headMehlman is LYING when he says Rove was just trying to keep abum article from being printed (as if Rove were just a freelancefactchecker for the MSM). No, Rove was trying to smear JoeWilson for telling the truth and he did it by attacking JoeWilson's wife and endangering national security.And why is this about loyalty to a political hack?Why won't Bush be loyal to his country first and his croniessecond?Why won't Bush be loyal to the truth?Why won't Bush be loyal to his word?
