11/07/2004 12:01:00 AMThe New York Times calls for dumping the electoral college.Maybe it will resonate with Bush because he came within150,000 votes in Ohio of winning the popular vote comfortablybut watching another man become President. Since he is alsoon his way out, no one could accuse Bush of partisanship ortrying to gain undue advantage. In fact, he's the perfect personto push for this, since Bush has been on both sides of theissue.That reform -- I believe it would be a constitutionalamendment -- would fly through both Houses and the Statesas long as it's unencumbered by any other addendums. Itwould end the absurd practice of politicians running forPresident ignoring 3/4s of the population to focus on folks in aminority of states. Smaller states with fewer voters would stillhave the leverage of two senators. And since political adswould now be national buys, they'd still be able to get sick ofall that campaigning in Iowa. And naturally it would be a greatencouragement for civic duty since people living anywhere inthe country -- Texas or California (red or blue) -- would knowthat their vote really did matter.Other common sense reforms are desperately needed:1. Optical scanners have the highest accuracy and lowestdefault rates of any machines. But choosing one systemnationally might be tricky. Let's stick with this, at the veryleast: it must be against federal law for votes to be caston machines that don't produce a paper trail and don'tprovide for a recount. That paper trail must be available forthe voter to verify before leaving the booth. It must also beagainst federal law for a state to provide different votingmachines in different counties. One standard must apply toall voters. Cheaper, older machines tend to be located in poorneighborhoods and have a much higher reject rate,disenfranchising those voters. Your ability to vote and thelikelihood of your vote being valid should not depend on whatneighborhood you live in.2. All voters must provide some form of state or federalid. (Copy of birth certificate, driver's license, state id, passport,voter registration card, Social Security card, Medicare card,Veteran's card, welfare card, etc.) It need not have a photo. Ifa voter does not have that, proof of residence -- a cable orphone or electric bill -- will allow them to vote if they swear totheir identity. If they don't have that, the voter will be given aprovisional ballot and ten days to meet those standards set outabove. I voted in New York City and I came with a driver'slicense (which had a different address than where I amregistered), a voter's registration card, a cable and electric billand about a dozen other forms of id and they asked to seenothing. I told them my name, scrawled my signature andvoted. That's ridiculous.)This will be a problem for the elderly and the poor -- all ofwhom are less likely to have what most of us would consider agiven, such as a driver's license or state id. But including thiswill bring aboard many Republicans (who have been pushing
