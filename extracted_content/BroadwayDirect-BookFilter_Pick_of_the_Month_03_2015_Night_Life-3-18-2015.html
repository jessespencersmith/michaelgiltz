Night Life
By David C. Taylor
Usually, it’s the critics who kill a show’s dreams on Broadway. But in this hard-bitten noir fromdebut novelist David C. Taylor, the bodies are literally piling up on the Great White Way. This1954 mystery is no breezy backstage romp. Our hero Michael Cassidy is a New York City copcalled in when the dead bodies of chorus boys start appearing with unnerving regularity.Cassidy is perfect for the job: his father is a successful Broadway producer and his godfather isa Mafia boss. Your typical cop, he’s not. With the McCarthy hearings as an ominous backdropand everyone from the FBI to the mob taking an interest in the case, Cassidy has his hands fullin what should be the start to an intriguing series that takes its theater as seriously as its
crimes.  Learn more.
