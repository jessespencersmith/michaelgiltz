 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyDVD: SciFi Silly, Serious and
Everything In Between
I've always loved science fiction, one of the most flexible of genres. It's a canvas for startling and
surprising leaps of the imagination. It can hold up a mirror to our current world by exaggerating trends.It's pure escapism. It's social commentary. And it's fun. Here are five titles that run the gamut.

<p>ROBOT CHICKEN STAR WARS III  ($19.98 BluRay or $14.98 regular; Warner Bros.)
BRAZIL ON BLURAY  $26.98; Universal)
BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS  ($26.97 BluRay or $19.93 regular)
SUCKER PUNCH  ($35.99 BluRay or $28.98 regular; Warner Bros.)
DAMNATION ALLEY  ($19.93; Shout)
I'd like to give props to the much maligned George Lucas for allowing Seth Green and friends the
freedom to tease and parody the Star Wars  world via Robot Chicken.  It's too loving to term it a vicious
parody; these Emmy-nominated specials could only have been made by fans deeply in love with theoriginals. But still, credit where credit is due. The more jokes you get, the geekier you are (and the moreyou laugh, so it's not so bad).
Brazil  is easily the best of the bunch here. Its a perfect example of how sci-fi can illuminate so well our
fears and desires, all while delivering a tale of a dystopian future that is funny, smart and oh so bleak.
This is the original US theatrical cut, so you'll have to wait for Criterion's Bluray to see all the variationson this much-edited film.
Battle Beyond The Stars  is Roger Corman at his most ambitious. It's a baldheaded attempt to cash in on
Star Wars mania, but this time Corman actually spent some money. Never fear: he recycled much of the
effects and sets for years to come. Not good, but an early break for some serious talent.
Sucker Punch  shows director Zack Snyder becoming less and less interested in coherence as time goes
on.
Finally,  Damnation Alley  is pure silliness with survivors of a nuclear holocaust looking to cross a
radiation belt to reach other survivors. Corman in B movie mode, again presented lovingly by Shout. If
you like Westerns, there's no reason to sniff at this similar trek through hostile territory that a millionWesterns employed as well.

<p>BUSTER KEATON SHORT FILMS COLLECTION 1920-1923  ($34.95; Kino) -- Film Forum in
Manhattan  has been packing them in on Mondays with an ongoing Buster Keaton retrospective. And no
wonder: his movies are pure delight with Keaton easily the equal of Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and
Laurel & Hardy, to name some contemporaries. You might have seen The General  but his shorts are
much harder to track down. No more, now that Kino has this terrific collection of 19 shorts lovinglyrestored and filled with bonus features. They date from 1920-1923 and from "The High Sign" to "TheLove Nest" they are bursting with great gags, witty stories and that deadpan mug.
OF GODS AND MEN  ($45.99 BluRay combo; Sony Pictures Classics) -- A disarmingly simple film
about faith. Monks living in Algeria know a vicious group of rebels is on the loose and will come soon tokill them. Why don't they take the army's offer of protection? Why don't they flee? This movie providessome answers by watching these very human men as they go about their lives and then face this horrificchoice of abandoning the poor people they've lived in harmony with for years or face likely death. It'smoving and illuminating. But me? I identify with the monk who quite understandably thought hidingunder his bed and evading death was not such a bad idea after all.

<p>BEST OF SESAME STREET SPOOFS VOLUME ONE AND TWO  ($19.98; Warner Bros.) --
Parents looking to share some silliness with their little kids can happily enjoy this collection of spoofs
that cover everything from TV to movies to music. Sometimes the spoofs are very pointed; other timesthey just play off a title. But they're all goofy and the weak ones are over soon. "Mad, Mad Men," "Hill
Street Twos" (one of my favorites), "OOOO-Klahoma!" and "True Mud" show the gang is staying nimble
right up to the present.
UNCLE BOONMEE  ($27.99; Strand) -- Terence Malick's Tree Of Life  is a walk in the park compared to
this Thai film about reincarnation that also won the top prize at Cannes and charmed critics worldwide.
Be prepared to end your viewing of the film with more question than when you began and you couldenjoy this strikingly photographed meditation that covers centuries of time, ghostly dead relatives wholook like monkeys and a very lascivious catfish. One of a kind and more accessible than the rest ofdirector Apichatpong Weerasethakul's body of work.

<p>BLACK MOON  ($39.95 each on BluRay; Criterion) Some of my favorite films by director Louis Malle
focus on boys and young men, such as Au Revoir Les Enfant, Murmur Of The Heart and Lacombe,
Lucien. But he has put young women front and center at times, as shown by these two Criterionpresentations out on BluRay. Zazie  is a very atypical comedy with the Eloise-like heroine creating all
sorts of havoc as she hangs out with her gay uncle. The even odder Black Moon  shows Cathryn Harrison
stranded in a farmhouse while war rages on outside. her budding sexuality soon lights a match to the
household, which was far from stable in the first place. Neither film is among his best but Criterion
presents them with its usual painstaking care.
ALSO OUT:
SOUTHLAND COMPLETE SECOND SEASON  ($34.99; Warner Bros.) -- The little show that
wouldn't die will be back for a third season. This set of episodes from season two contains brief touches
of language and the like that didn't make the cut for its cable airings but don't change the essential nature
of this solid ensemble about cops in the LAPD.
THE MAKING OF THE PRESIDENT: THE 1960S  ($59.99; Athena) -- I'd often heard of the famous
nonfiction book by Theodore H. White called The Making Of The President, 1960  that won the Pulitzer
Prize and changed the coverage of politics forever. Yet I had no idea it also spawned a series of TV
documentaries. But here they are: TV specials 80 minutes in length covering the campaigns of 1960, 1964and 1968. If you liked The War Room, here's an even more penetrating look...from the outside.
THE SACRIFICE  ($39.95; Kino) -- A newly remastered print of Andrei Tarkovsky's slow moving,
deeply felt final film about people facing the likelihood of being wiped out in a nuclear holocaust. An
excellent bonus feature is Directed By Andre Tarkovsky,  a warm but unblinkered look at the director by
his editor on this film.
DAMAGES SEASON THREE  ($39.95; Sony) -- This juicy melodrama continues to benefit from some
of the most enjoyable casting on television. This season they feature Martin Short, Ted Danson, Campbell
Scott and Lily Tomlin key roles, all of them eating it up with relish. Glenn Close is at the center of it all aslitigator Patty Hewes and she's probably thrilled to be working on this instead of some dumb, unsatisfying
movie where they'd want her to play the mother to some talentless hack.
DAS BOOT COLLECTOR'S SET  ($35.99 BluRay; Sony) -- I have the happy problem of trying to keep
track of tons of DVDs and what comes out when. How? By clearing off a bookcase and sorting the DVDs
by week as they come in. Sometimes, friends come in and rifle through them and then replace the titleson the wrong shelf and I don't notice. That might explain why I reviewed Das Boot weeks before it cameout. By accident. It's out now and it's a classic and if you haven't seen it you should. Check out my reviewhere.
THE LINCOLN LAWYER  ($39.99 BluRay or $29.95 regular; Lionsgate) -- Actor Matthew
McConaughey provides his usual rakish charm to this thriller about a high-flying attorney who chooses to
do business out of the backseat of his car (why waste money on office space?). Ryan Phillippe is the
wealthy young client embroiled in rape and murder charges who sucks our hero into a world of betrayaland lies. Not a flop, but probably not the start of a franchise for McConaughey, who has always beenmore charming than his taste in material.
POIROT SET 6  ($59.99 BluRay or $49.99 regular; Acorn) -- Three more TV movies starring David
Suchet as the unflappable Hercule Poirot, the master sleuth created by Agatha Christie. No one gets away
with murder when Poirot is around. God help the network executive who ever tries to kill this series,which just continues to roll along 22 years after Suchet began.
