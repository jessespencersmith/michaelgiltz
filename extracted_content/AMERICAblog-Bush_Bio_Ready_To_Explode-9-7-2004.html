9/07/2004 06:54:00 PMJohn has made a few references to this, but Kitty Kelley is ready toroll out her Bush dynasty potboiler on Tuesday, September 14. Kelleydigs up lots of dirt and -- as far as I know -- has never beensuccessfully sued for libel, so she gets her facts right enough to fightoff lawsuits.Gossip columnist Cindy Adams had this to say today:"Last month I reported biographer Kitty Kelley's coming Bush familyvivisection has, what she considers, 'five major revelations,' one ofwhich is a supposedly documented inch-by-inch on Dubya's so-calledmissing-year service record. I now report a big-time TV magazineshow is on that case. Wrapping up footage even as we speak. Kitty,who's done her jobs on Nancy, Jackie, Elizabeth, Sinatra etc., has apublication date later this month."Does this count as a "September Surprise?"
