'Boondocks' new season on hold 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
'BOONDOCKS," Cartoon 
Network's witty, contro­
versial series, won't re­
turn this year as expected, says 
show creator Aaron McGruder. 
The second season of the ani­
mated series, based on the 
"Boondocks" comic strip, was 
given a late 2006/winter 2007 
date to return to Cartoon Net­
work's late-night block, Adult 
Swim: after its hugely success­
ful first season (it was the 
highest-rated series premiere 
in Cartoon Network history). 
Network execs, in fact, 
bumped the number of "Boon­
docks" episodes up from 15 to 
20 -which seems to have con­
tributed to the delay. 
"Our production schedule is 
really, really long," says 
McGruder, who's publicizing 
, the first-season DVD (Sony; 
$49.95). 
"We're halfway through the 
writing and just getting under 
way with the animation." 
McGruder now says fans should look for the series to re­
turn in March. 
"Boondocks," which gives 
"Chappelle's Show" a run for 
its money in smartly tackling 
issues of race and politics, de­
picts Huey, a IO-year-old revo­
lutionary with a keen sense of 
leftist politics and history. 
He struggles to find purpose 
living in a white suburb with 
his cranky granddad and wan­
nabe gangsta little brother, 
Riley. 
The "Boondocks" delays have 
spurred talk that Sony might 
be bringing in a new showrun­
ner to replace McGruder , ru­
mors dismissed by a spokes­
person. 
(Cartoon Network execs 
were traveling to the TV Crit­
ics tour in L.A. and were un­
available for comment.) 
But unlike Dave Chappelle , 
who famously walked away 
from his Comedy Central sc-
o ries after snaring a $55 million 
deal, this clearly isn't a case of 
McGruder losing interest or 
feeling pressure. It's more about an artist 
wanting to do the best work he 
can. 
One episode from last sea­
son, for instance, featured an 
anime-style fight between 
Huey and Riley. 
"That was fun," says 
McGruder, 32. "It's also been 
our biggest challenge. 
"We're creating a new sys­
tem on-the-fly to get an au­
thentic anime style but still 
have it be written with an 
American comedic sensibility, 
"It's really hard," he says. 
"We're working more and 
more with artists overseas, We 
now have a Japanese anime 
studio named Madhous e to 
help us out. 
"I was happy with a lot of 
season one, but I thought a lot 
of it could look better. We're 
really passionat e artists, 
'The people working with 
me on the show are phenome· 
nal, phenomenal artists and 
they really care about getting it 
right."</p>
