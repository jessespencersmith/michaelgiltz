            <p>Cohen's poetry at lincoln Center
BY MICHAEL G,TLTZ,
omposer Philip Glass is performing a
concert piece built around the poems
of Leonard Cohen at Lincoln Center
next Saturday and Sunday. Cohen, the
acclaimed Canadianpoet and singe4
has a prior commitment and won't be able to
attend l'Book of Longing," named afterhis
best-sellin g 2006 collection of poems.
But even if he were free, Glass says he wouldn't have a
clue as to whether Cohen would show up or not. The show
will incorporate musicians (including Glass), four singers,
and Cohen's artwork, along with taped recordings of Co-
hen reading his poetry. But Cohen himself won't pedorm.
"He's at awonderful place in his life where he does
whatever he damn well feels like," says Glass fondly
about Cohen. "He doesn't do anything - as far as I can
tell - to please people. He does things to please himself."
It's not selfishness on Cohen's part, just a realization
at age 72 and a lifetime of acclaim that he should focus
on what's best for him. So tell Cohen it would be great if
he showed up for a certain event and he'll nod sagely and
seem to agree, but not actually say anything.Philip Glass recycles Leonard
That mysterious aura has been a constant in the rela-
tionship between the two for almost 25 years. In 1984,
Glass set a poem of Cohen's to music as part of Que-
bec's 3S0th-anniversary eelebration. He sent it off to get
permission, and the permission came ... but not a word
from Cohen himself. Did he like it? Did he hate it?'Did
he even heor it? Glass simply didn't know.
Almost a decade ago, they began discussing this cur-
rent collaboration. Then Cohen disappeared, becoming
a monk, studying under a master and abandoning con-
temporary life for some five years while ensconced in a
Zen monastery on Mount Baldy in Southern California.
Cohen "plays it down a lot, says he wasn't great in
the 'renunciation department,"' says Glass, a long-
time NewYorker who was famously driving a cab in
1976 when his ground-breaking opera "Einstein on the
Beach" was being performed at the Met. "But he did live
like a monk. It takes courage to do that. I don't have it."
Now they've finally come together, pushing singers
from the world of opera, Broadway and cabaret to de- .
velop a distinctive style of singing for this particularpiece, a style Cohen has dubbed "Glassic."
It's a good moment for Cohen, who's recovering
rm financial mismanagement that reportedlv left him from financial mismanagement that reportedly
nearly bankrupt, despite a world-renowned music cata-
logue. His prot6g6 and partner Anjani Thomas released
her collaborationwith Cohen, "Blue Light," last year.
And on Aug. 7, Jennifer Warnes will issue a 20th-anni-
versary edition of Cohen's "Famous Blue Raincoat."
Glass, of course, is always busy. Now 70, he's tour-
ing with "Book of Longing," just enjoyed a revival of his
Gandhi opera "Satyagraha" in London (it comes to the
Met next year), has several film scores due including
Woody Allen's new "Cassandra's Dream," and debuts
his opera "Appomattox" in San Francisco in October.
And viewers of a recent Paul Sirion tribute on PBS saw
Glass' instrumental take on "The Sounds of Silence."
Which brings up more unfinished Cohen business.
"I've known Paul a longtime and I discovered he and
Leonard don't know each other, and I'm going to fix
that," says Glass. "They should know each other, and
they will, if I have anything to do with it." t</p>
