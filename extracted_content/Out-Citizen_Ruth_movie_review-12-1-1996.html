            <p>Citizen Ruth 
directed by Alexander Payne 
A CAUSTIC YET VERY funny movie 
about abortion rights? You bet. Hapless, 
glue-sniffing, pregnant drifter Ruth 
(Laura Dern) 
finds herself 
pushed and 
pulled by pro­
and anti-choice 
forces when a 
judge offers to 
reduce her jail time for shoplifting if she 
terminates her pregnancy. In opposite 
corners are Swoosie Kurtz, playing an 
undercover lesbian pro-choice activist 
(pictured, page 72, with Dern), and 
Mary Kay Place, as a sweet but 
implacable pro-life housewife. Though 
the movie takes shots at both sides, it 
really gives it to the religious Right­
especially during an outrageous cameo 
by Burt Reynolds as a holier-than-thou 
pro-life leader. Still, you'll root for the 
none-roo-bright Ruth-who can never 
think further than her next chance to 
abuse a substance-to outwit them all. 
Dern deserves another Oscar 
nominati on for her hilarious, edgy 
performance, and the clever screenplay 
by director Alexander Payne and Jim 
Taylor builds wonderfully . Comparisons 
to Preston Sturges are not out of order.
