From the Publisher: After his mother's death, eleven-year-old Marcus is
sent to live on a small South Carolina island with his great aunt, a
reclusive painter with a haunted past. Aunt Charlotte, otherwise a woman
of few words, points out a ruined cottage, telling Marcus she had visited itregularly after she'd moved there thirty years ago because it matched theruin of her own life. Eventually she was inspired to take up painting so she
could capture its utter desolation. The islanders call it "Grief Cottage,"
because a boy and his parents disappeared from it during a hurricane fiftyyears before. Their bodies were never found and the cottage has stoodempty ever since. During his lonely hours while Aunt Charlotte is in herstudio painting and keeping her demons at bay, Marcus visits the cottage
daily, building up his courage by coming ever closer, even after the ghost
of the boy…

What We Say
Gail Godwin follows up her precisely poised novel "Flora" with this literary ghost story about an orphaned eleven year old
boy named Marcus. Sent off to live with an aunt he's never met, Marcus is naturally wary and eager to please. But AuntCharlotte is a prickly, hard to read sort who says exactly what she thinks but somehow leaves Marcus wondering about the
subtext of what she means. Is he in the way? Will she grow bored with him and send Marcus away? Plus, exactly how much
wine can this eccentric woman drink in a single day? And then there's Grief Cottage, falling-down eyesore on the beach thatAunt Charlotte paints over and over again (selling the results to support herself) while Marcus is drawn closer to it every dayShare This Book

<p>until once, he swears, he sees the ghostly apparition of the little boy who disappeared from that home some 50 years ago.
Sadly, some vivid characters and Godwin's elegant writing can't disguise a story that feels far too thought out to come alive.
Marcus is an almost absurdly mature eleven year old boy in his inner thoughts. One can accept a precocious child (indeed,
his friend Wheezer is just such a character) but Marcus's inner dialogue strains credulity. This problem worsens as the novelgoes on and we spend more and more time close to his subconscious. And it all falls apart in the dramatic, atypical finale.Even this is marred further by an epilogue that spells things out far too neatly. A disappointing effort. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
"Something between a search for understanding and a mournful confession . . . A testament to the power of
storytelling to bring solace when none other is possible." - Washington Post on FLORA
"Remorse may be the defining emotion for our narrator, Helen, but Godwin the writer has nothing to regret:Flora is an elegant little creeper of a story." - Maureen Corrigan, NPR Fresh Air
"Flora is a beautiful examination of character and the far-reaching repercussions of our actions. Gail Godwin
brings grace, honesty, and enormous intelligence to every page." - Ann Patchett
"Flora is Godwin at her best, a compelling story about Helen's growth of consciousness told with fearless candor
and the poignant wisdom of hindsight." - Boston Globe
"A chronicle of her life as a writer whose career has been boosted and buffeted by the vagaries of the publishing
industry. She has made of it a suspenseful account, with . . . emotional depth, too." -  Wall Street Journal on
PUBLISHING"A memoir in the old sense of the term, a story with a scope of five decades written by an author of somerenown . . . You donât have to be a hungry writer…
