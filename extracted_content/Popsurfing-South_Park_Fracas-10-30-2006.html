            <p>M O N D AY,  O C TO B E R  3 0 ,  2 0 0 6"South Park" FracasUPDATE: Now IMDB.com is claiming Steve Irwin's widow isdevastated over the "South Park" reference to Irwin's death and scaredthat their two children might accidentally see it. Then an Irwincompatriot suggests people place poisonous animals in the homes ofthe show's creators. Way to keep the spirit of Steve Irwin alive: useanimals to frighten and kill people! An Australian TV network says theyMIGHT air the episode next year or in 2008, which the friend insists isstill "too soon." As for fears that her kids might see it: the daughter isnow 8 and the son will turn 3 in December. Assuming the episode isshown in Australia two years from now, they'll be 10 and 5. What thehell would any decent parent be doing let a ten year old and a five yearold watch an adult TV show like South Park which typically doesn'teven air until late at night (10 p.m. in the US) and is filled withexpletives? It's not a kiddie show, for heaven's sake.Last week I wrote about the last episode of "South Park" and howconsistently amusing I've found the show recently. In it, Satan isthrowing himself a Super Sweet 16 Birthday Party (a la the spoiled girlson that MTV reality show) and it takes place at Halloween so everyonewears a costume. Now some people are upset that the show included ajoke about Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin. Yes, I'm sure his familywouldn't be ready to see such a joke, but you don't make TV showsgeared towards a handful of privileged people. And in fact the idea thatit would be tacky for someone to dress as Steve Irwin this Halloweenwas the very point of the joke: Satan spots the guy and asks him toleave, saying it's "just too soon" to come as Steve Irwin. Then Irwinsays no, it's really him and Satan makes him leave anyway because he'snot wearing a costume. Yes, it was a joke about Irwin but it also sentout the message that "doing" Irwin this Halloween would be crass.Mind you, I doubt the Irwin family would be pleased to see anyonedressing as him ever -- especially if they had a stingray sticking out oftheir chest as he did on the show. But really, complaining about thisseems silly -- if you're easily offended, surely you shouldn't be watching"South Park" in the first place.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT 12:43 PM
