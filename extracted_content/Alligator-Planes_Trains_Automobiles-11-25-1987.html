PI,/:.I 
This is a new movie made rhe old-' 
fashioncd way: wirh sryle, wir, a warm lirtle " 
message and a big dollop of semim(:mak :' 
ity. 
PI./l/e.r. 1',."il1.r '/l/d AII/{J"/fJ/;ile .r is a rale 
about Neal Page (Steve Marrin), a dapper, 
reserved businessman who wams norhing 
more rha n to fly home for 
Thanksgiving . But his plane i~ 
delayed and rhen rerouted. So 
he decides to take the train. BUI 
it runs our of st<:am. So h<:Tem~ 
a car. But ir expl()des. 
Yes, danger dogs .rh~ par!l ot 
Neal, but' none more frighten­
ing than blustery Del (;riffith 
<.John Candy), .1 noisy sh()wer­
ring :;alesman who. manages ttl 
steer Neal wrong every st<:p'(lf 
the woly. If Del says, "C() right," 
you Gill be sure you'd be((~r ' glr 
left. 
Bur Neal is an ~Imi;;ble fell()\\ 
and everything t)e1 sugg<:st~ 
seems reasonable umil disaster 
strikes. Perhaps the biggest di:-.· 
aster of all is Del hims<:lf, ,\11 
overbearingly fri<:l1dly guy, rhl' 
type of fellow wh() ac('osts you 
on a plane and ne\'er lets up. 
You'd like to tell him to bug oft 
but, well, he's nic<: ;Ind you don'( 
wam to hurr his feelings. 
Neither does Neal. He 
remains unflappable umil an 
early scene in a hotel nfl n­
where Del's scratching, burp· • 
ing. throat-dearin .g and orlwr 
'ratin' habits finallv ~ush him</p>
<p>over the edge. 
That's when Ne.iI cuts lo()sc. 
venting all his anger' mi. .. 
haples. anger who is so inno­
cently messing up his life. 80th 
actors are un the mark the 
entire movie, but this is where they sluo<:. 
Martin explodes with pent-up energy in ;1 
hilarious tirade that voices everything wc've 
secretly thought about Del. ---+-"1 
We Qln't heIp laughing, but we catch 
ourselves feeling guilty because the pain in 
Del's eyes is so apparent. This is Candy's 
first real rule and he makes the most of it, 
playj.ga, with a sweet but honest intens-
jey; he !mews Del can be anno in' bYlllc:._ ........ 
likes..mmGOfWay. 
After Neal' Sputtersfo a finish, ~ 
deli'gen • e speech in which Dd 
defendS 1UmseIf quietly and with di 'n'.!J.i~·_~~ 
It',. a wondel'fuhce'ne. the type that lets 
you sit back lHId-chink. "Yes. this movie is 
going to be good:' But Writeri Din.'Ccur 
John Hu~ohes neverc.lpiralizes on it. He lets 
the characters revert to their antagonistic 
relationship as they muddle their wa)' 
througQ one predictable transportation 
problem after ,mother. 
There's another honest S<.-ene near the 
end, but Hughes cile-.lts again on the climax. 
There is a fe-.lrful reunion betw(.~n Page and_ 
his wife,.m incidental character who speaks 
all of 10 lines in the movie. Like Del (iriffith. 
we c.m unly stand in the b-.lckgruund smiling 
distr.l(tedly. . 
And like Del Griffith, P/,IIIt:J. Tn/illJ ,lilt! 
A III 0 II/obi/"J has its prublems. It has ~ 
playful score fraught with inappropriarcr: ·' -'" 
ruck music. a predict.tble story amI a sappy 
ending. Bu] Mar~in and Gmdy are wonder ~'"i'> > 
lui. they man¢ 0 be funny most of tht: . 
time and its' heart is in the right pl.tcc and. . 
well, it's nice. Amt I don't want to be the ont: 
to hurt its feelinJ.,'S.
