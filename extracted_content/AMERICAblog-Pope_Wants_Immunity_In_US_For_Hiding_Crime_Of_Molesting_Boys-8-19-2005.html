8/19/2005 02:37:00 AMAccording to AP, Pope Benedict is asking the White House toclarify that he has diplomatic immunity and can't be tried forconspiring to cover up the molestation of three boys by a Texasseminarian. The Church repeatedly and consistently shows noremorse for any of these awful crimes and kicks out andpunishes the child molesters in their midst only when it isabsolutely necessary. The Church uses every legal tacticimaginable, which is its legal right but shows a stunning lack ofcompassion and grace and a true Christian desire forforgiveness. (Thanks to DailyKos and reader Cedwyn forpointing us to this.)I needn't point out the irony of this brazen attempt to duckreponsibility coming out while the Pope is in Europe for WorldYouth Day.You CANNOT be forgiven until you honestly and willinglyconfess all your sins and truly intend to sin no more. When itcomes to child molestation, the Catholic Church has never evencome close to beginning this process. Huge scandals haverocked the Church around the world in the 70s, the 80s, the90s and there is no doubt they will come again.
