10/27/2004 01:58:00 PMAbraham Lincoln said he didn't claim that God was on his side in theCivil War -- he humbly prayed that he was on God's side. Bush has nosuch modesty of course. But a new LA Times article shows trouble inevangelical land."An estimated 80% of the evangelical vote went to Bush in 2000,"says the LA Times. "But Bush's senior political strategist, Karl Rove,said after the 2000 election that the president might have won therace against Democrat Al Gore by a comfortable margin had 4 millionmore evangelicals gone to the polls rather than sitting out theelection....""A poll published last week by the Pew Research Center for the Peopleand the Press found that 70% of self-described evangelicals orborn-again Christians planned to vote for the president, down from74% in the same survey three weeks earlier. That was not only aslight decline, but lower than the 80% to 90% support that Bushcampaign officials had been forecasting."In other words, the support for Bush among evangelical groups islower than 2000 -- when he lost the popular vote -- and in seriousfreefall. They got 80% last time and hoped to get 90%. Now they'relooking at 70%. That is a major, major problem for Bush. And hisrecent pandering -- I don't hate gay people, that General wasnaughty to say we're fighting a holy war against Satan -- ain't gonnahelp.By the way, as John has pointed out before, evangelicals are notsome monolithic group. A significant minority support a woman'sright to choice. 1 out of 5 that voted in 2000 did NOT vote for Bush.All in all, it's the Good News for Kerry.
