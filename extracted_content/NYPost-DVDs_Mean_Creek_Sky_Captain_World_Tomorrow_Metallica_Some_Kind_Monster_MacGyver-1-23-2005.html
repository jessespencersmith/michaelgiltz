I:: 
Sky captain and the 
World of Tomorrow **1/2 Paramount, $29.99 
An all-digital film (with 
actors inserted into the action) 
is a landmark. But what matters 
is the movie -here, it's a 
pretty funny "Indiana Jones" 
style adventure with robots 
attacking Earth. Jude Law and 
(especially) Angelina Jolie have 
the right swagger, but Gwyneth 
Paltrow seems lost. Lots of 
extras detail how writer­
director Kerry Conran 
managed to pull it off. 
Metallica: Some Kind 
of Monster **1/2 
Paramount, $29.99 
Who knew metal heads had 
"abandonment issues"? A feast 
for fans, this overlong 
documentary watches the 
massively successful band 
:M:etallica deal with rehab, 
intense pressure and an in­
house therapist while 
recording its new album. As 
always, directors Joe Berlinger 
and Bruce Sinofsky ("Paradise 
Lost") get great material, but 
struggle to craft a narrative. 
MacGyver First 
Season **1/2 
Paramount, $38.99 
Give him a piece of gum and 
a paper clip and secret agent Mean 
Creek 
*** Paramount, $29.99 
This gem of a film 
follows a couple of 
kids (including Rory 
Culkin) as they pull a 
prank on the sch001 
bully. Devastating in 
its simplicity, it's an 
auspicious debut for 
writer-director Jacob 
Aaron Estes. Other 
gems just out in 
special editions: The 
Beatles biopic 
"Backbeaf' 
(Universal, $19.98), 
"October Sky" 
(Universal, $14.98) 
and "The Crying 
Game" (Lions Gate, 
$19.98). 
Angus MacGyver (Richard 
Dean Anderson) will be able to 
pilot a plane by remote control, 
blow up a building on short 
notice and do pretty much 
anything else you can think of. 
Also just out: angsty teen 
drama "One Tree Hill" (Warner 
Bros, $59.98), PBS' "Inspector 
Alleyn Mysteries" (Acorn, 
$59.99) and "Homicide: Season 
Six" (A&E, $99.95). 
The warner 
GanGsters Collection **** Warner Bros., $68.92 
Six gangster flicks from the 
studio that made them better 
than anyone else, all loaded 
with extras like commentary, 
shorts, newsreels and more. 
Humphrey Bogart, Edward G. 
Robinson and James Cagney 
snarl their way through "The 
Public Enemy" (1931), "White 
Heat" (1949), "Little Caesar" 
(1930) and much more -
including one memorable 
finale where Cagney heads to 
the electric chair.</p>
