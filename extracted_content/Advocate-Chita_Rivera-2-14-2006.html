ChitaRivera
She's been nominated for eightTany
awards fwinning twice) and in 2AAZ
received the Kennedy Center's life-
time achievement honor. She'll live
forever in theater history far her
roles in the original st Side Story
and Chicaga. So it's no surprise that
on January 23,Rivera spent herT3rd
birthday right where she belongs: on
Sroadway, in Chita Rivera: The
Dancels Life,with its book byTer-
rence McNally. Rivera scoffs at the
idea of Broadway musicals*and
thus her caree ithout the input
of gay people. "Oh, please," she says
with a laugh, "lt's insane to imagine
the world without thern,"

In your show you
talk about choreog-
raphers like Jack
Cole, who did such
shows as A Funny
Thing Happened on
the Way to the
Forum and films
such as Gentlemen
Prefer BIondes.You
were good friends
with Cole and his
paruner.
That's why l'm so
happy to speak
about him. Jack
Cole was one of the
most fascinating
people you could
meet in the entire
world. Nobody
made Marilyn Mon-
roe or Jane Russell
or Gwen Verdonmore female than
he did. This man
was male and
female-he was
everything. I really
think to be a full
person, everyone
should be. You've
got to be it all,
You certainly cut a
strong figure in
your cameo for the
movie Chicago.
I thought I looked
like Cher in dragl lf
there is such a
thing. God, was
that fun. IDirector]
Rob Marshall is one
of my best friends.
When he took me
around the set, I
was ready to justjump in there. I
was ready to tel I
Catherine Zeta-
Jones she had an
appointment.
In Egypt.
You worked with
Jerome Robbins-
a stern taskmaster,
even for a choreog-
rapner.
He was hard; he
was difficult. A lot
of people hated
him. Everybody
tried desperately
for me to say some-
thing shitty about
him, excuse the ex-
pression. lLaughsl
But I won't. Any-
body that ever
worked for him, hemade them better.
And that's what
you're there for.
To get better.
And it doesn't get
better than Kander
and Ebb, who you
collaborated with
on Chicago, Kiss of
the SpiderWoman,
and The Rink.
They were my
honeys, my sweet-
hearts. At this age in
his life, John [Kan-
derl is just gorgeous.
You can see that
spirit in him coming
through his eyes.
Any chance of lhe
Visit-their last col-
laboration to makeit to the stage be-
fore Fred Ebb died-
still making it to
Broadway?
Well, that's what
we hope we'll get to
do. Iln lhe Dancels
Lifel I did one of
the songs, "Love
and Love Alone."
It's a wrencher-it's
so smart, it's so
passionate, it's so
simple. [She starts
to recite the lyricsl
"When you're young
/ Feeling oh so
strong / What can
prove you wrong? /
Love and love alone
/ When the sun /
Seems forever
bright / What can
dim its light? /Love and love
alone, I So beware
young love / Lost in
a kiss / There's a
truth, young love /
Simple as this /
Every fond hello
ends in goodbye /
What we're certain
will live / Will die."
It's gorgeous, Gor-
geous! And Freddie
used to say he
hated writing bal-
lads. And I used to
slap him. llaughs]
As well you should.
As well I should!
And l'm the only
one who could. I
miss my Freddie
desperately. He's
my brother. I
