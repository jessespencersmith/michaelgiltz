"SCHINDLER'S UST" 
"THE TEN COMMANDMENTS" 
You'll notice that Steven Spielberg hasn't said any­
thing publicly about "The Passion of the Christ" or 
the Holocaust-denying comments of Mel Gibson and 
his dad. Perhaps it's because Spielberg said every­
thing he possibly could with this penetrating, shatter­
ing 1993 drama ($26.98, Universal) about Oskar 
Schindler and the Jews he helped save during World 
War II. But talk about heavenly timing! Cecil B. De­
Mille's 1956 kitschy joy of an epic "The Ten Com­
mandments" ($19.99, Paramount) couldn't have come 
out at a better time. 
THE CHAPUN COllECTION: VOLUME lWO 
It·s impossibl e to fault the terrific presentation of 
these movies. Still, just like Volume One, this is a 
mixed bag, albeit a bargain ($99.92, Warner Bros.). 
"The Circus," "City Lights" and "The Kid" are essen­
tials, with "The Chaplin Revue" a grab-bag of shorts 
made for First National (which sounds like a bank). 
But "A Woman of Paris," "A King in New York" and 
UMonsieur Verdoux" are mere curiosities in compari­
son. And the only reason to watch Richard Schlck­
el's unrevealing documentary "Charlie: The Life and 
Art of Charles Chaplin" is to see the clips. 
liTHE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW": SWOt. THREE 
"The Dick Van Dyke Show" continues to get the 
loving treatment that all great shows deserve with 
this third-season set ($69.99, Image). It includes more 
great extras (including a complete episode of "The 
Danny Thomas Show" with Morey Amsterdam ), and 
one great moment after another -especially Laura 
(Mary Tyler Moore) mortified over a nude drawing 
of her appearing in an art gallery and the classic sea­
son opener in willch Rob is convinced they've 
brought the wrong baby home from the hospital. 
"TO SERVE THEM ALL MY DAYS" 
This delightful13-part miniseries from 1980 ($79.99, 
Acorn) is virtually the model for every show that 
aired on "Masterpiece Theatre." It's set in a British 
boarding school between the wars, has a sterling cast, 
a modest budget, and a propensity for dramatic plot 
twists that would shame a daytime soap. Adapted by 
the terrific Andrew Davies from a beloved novel, it 
tells the warm. touching story of a poor Welsh coal 
miner's son who overcomes shellshoek to fall in love 
with the elite school Bamfylde. 
Also out: 
Clive Owen -as good a pick as any for the next 
James Bond -in the absorbing 2000 crime flick 
"Croupier" ($19.99, Image); "NIona Lisa Smile" 
gives both a1l-girl schools and chick flicks a bad 
name; "Starsky & Hutch:" Season One ($49.95. Co­
lumbia TriStar), the cop show that spawned the 
amusing new movie starring Ben Stiller and Owen 
Wilson; "Futuram a" Vol. 3 ($49.98, Fox) is the sci-fi 
spoofs best season and if enough people buy it, they 
might revive the show; U.K. drama "The Second 
Coming" ($24.98, Shout) intelligently a.nd intrigu 
ingly imagines how people would react ifJesus came 
back; the original 1979 zombie nick/anti-capi,alist di­
atribe "Dawn of the Dead" ($19.98, Anchor Bay) 
comes out just in time for the remake. 
Out next week: 
Sean Penn's other marvelous performance from 
2003 in "21 Grams"; the boldly unconvention al '705 
TV show "Kung Fu"; and the Swedish idea of big TV 
fun, lngmar Bergman's "Scenes From a l\'Ia.rriage."</p>
