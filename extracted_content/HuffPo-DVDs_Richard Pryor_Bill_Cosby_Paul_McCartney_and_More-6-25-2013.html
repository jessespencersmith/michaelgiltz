            <p>DVDs: Richard Pryor, Bill Cosby, PaulMcCartney and More!
A host of great boxed sets and rare releases came out on DVD in the last few weeks,
from the brilliant Richard Pryor in concert (where he's at his best) to kid-friendly BillCosby to Paul McCartney wowing audiences on tour to the best new show ontelevision. Check them out.
NO PRYOR RESTRAINT: LIFE IN CONCERT  ($99.99
CD and DVD; Shout) -- Richard Pryor made somegreat movies. But he also made a lot of crappy ones,especially later on in his career. So it's good to havethis boxed set putting the spotlight back on what hedid best: stand-up. You get seven CDs of his bestalbums along with some two hours of previouslyunavailable material. You can actually hear Pryorfinding his voice and getting bolder and bolder. It's amore distilled version of his greatness that supplantsan earlier all-CD set. What makes this new box
definitive is the inclusion of his three concert films.
Comedy albums are great but for an artist like Pryor
who created characters onstage a la Lily Tomlin and
other masters, actually seeing him perform these monologues and tell these stories
and bring these people to life (like Mudbone) is essential. You don't need me to tellyou he's a genius. Plenty of celebs and fellow comics do that in brief tributes to Pryor.Combine this with Marina Zenocich's acclaimed new documentary about his life --Omit The Logic  is airing on Showtime right now  -- and you've got a terrific overview of
a brilliant, funny man.
FAT ALBERT AND THE COSBY KIDS THEC0MPLETE SERIES  ($119.99 DVD; Shout) -
- Bill Cosby is quoted in that Richard Pryorboxed set but he couldn't keep the educatorin him quiet -- Cosby felt obliged to grouse
that he wished people would be able to
separate Pryor's genius from his use of foul
language. Sometimes that tendency of Cosby
can make him seem a scold. Other times itencouraged him to do groundbreaking work,such as launching the kids' tv series FatAlbert and the Cosby Kids . Launched in
1972, it would appear in several differentiterations (usually after a three year rest),finally calling it a day in 1985 after 110episodes. An essay by Professor Gordon L.Berry included in the very handsome set fromShout makes you feel like you're eating yourspinach. And while the show isunquestionably educational in the SesameStreet sense with lessons on lying and theresponsibility of owning a pet and so on, it'salso funny and sweet and amusing as inner
city kids amuse themselves in a junkyard and around town. It features some low-rentanimation but a clever combination of live-action Bill Cosby offering jokes andcommentary and the cartoon characters (many of whom he voiced himself) made the
series very fresh. And needless to say its cast featuring black kids having fun and
mixed in with other shows on Saturday morning was the strongest, albeit subtlestlesson of all. We have so many TV channels now it's easy to segregate ourselvesagain. Back when this show launched and you only had four or five channels tochoose from, I watched Fat Albert  and The Jeffersons  and Sanford & Son  because I
thought they were funny and didn't watch What's Happening because I didn't think it
was funny. And that was the only reason. I didn't realize growing up in South FloridaMay 11, 2014

<p>what that meant but Bill Cosby did and knew how and why he wanted this show to be
on the air each weekend. Hearing Fat Albert say "Hey hey hey" in virtually almost
every sentence gets old very quickly but it's amazing how vividly I remember some ofthese episodes. Nostalgic adults and very young kids might still enjoy it but there's noquestion it's a landmark show that deserves this set.
3:10TO
YUMA  ($39.99 BluRay; Criterion)
JUBAL  ($29.99 BluRay; Criterion)
LIFE IS SWEET  ($39.99 BluRay; Criterion) --
When movie buffs make lists of the best filmsof all time, they're sure to include a fewwesterns like the usual suspects: TheSearchers, Red River, Stagecoach, HighNoon,  one of those Spaghetti westerns and
so on. But they don't always think of 3:10 ToYuma. They should. It's as trim and meanand beautifully acted and tense as any ofthose others. The more I see it, the more Ilove it. And the more I appreciate the greatGlenn Ford, the charismatic bad guy whocajoles and teases and worries the usuallybland Van Heflin into the performance of his
career. I hope you didn't watch the remake
and never do; this is the real deal. Criterion
does its usual impressive job of delivering a
great print and some key extras though thislean masterpiece doesn't need any.
In contrast, I've been completely unaware of Jubal, which sets Othello in the West tomixed results. It's a curiosity, with Eernest Borgnine as the unsuspecting ranchowner, Valerie French as his bored wife, Ford as the cattleman any woman would beattracted to and Rod Steiger as the trouble-making Iago who poisons the well foreveryone. Delmer Daves directed and I'm glad I saw it, though I'm not sure it deservesthe imprimatur of being part of Criterion.
There's no question that Life Is Sweet  is a masterpiece, a bleakly funny drama about
working class parents (hilarious Jim Broadbent and Alison Steadman) trying to raise
(or rather, not paying terribly much attention to) their twins. Director Mike Leigh is amaster and this might be the best introduction to his particular gifts of creating anutterly believable world. The extras here really are a treat. Leigh is a miserable sodwho treats interviews with about as much civility as a hostile interrogation. But herehe is talking about the film in an audio commentary, heard in a not too prickly
interview from 1991 and best of all we get five short films by Leigh. A modern classic.</p>
<p>PAUL MCCARTNEY AND WINGS:
ROCKSHOW  ($34.99 BluRay; EagleVision) 
STEVE EARLE: THE WARNER BROS.
YEARS  ($54.99 CDs and DVD; Shout/Rhino/Warner Bros.) -- Rockshow captures
Paul McCartney at a particularly ebullient moment in his long, storied and stillcreatively exciting career. Massive stadium tours were still very much a novelty in1976 and being able to hear McCartney actually perform from the Beatles catalogwas a new thrill. This two hour and ten minute concert features 30 songs and Paul isin wonderful voice throughout. It's not brilliantly shot but happily concert films hadn'tas yet developed the ADD that makes so many newer ones involve nothing but
furious editing with twenty or thirty or forty cuts during each number. Here the camera
actually pauses and captures a moment. Wings is not a great band but the songs and
the audience's delight and Paul's showmanship lift this up a great deal. If you're a
Beatles fan like me, this is unmissable. Though I'm still waiting for Let It Be.
Steve Earle is also still creating great music. It's a surprise to me he only made three
albums for Warner Bros. after getting out of jail and straightening his life around(drugs, of course). This boxed set contains three great albums -- Train A Comin', IFeel Alright, El Corazon -- and it's a credit to his talent and productivity that the nextone (a bluegrass album with the Del McCoury Band) is even better. That's sayingsomething. If you're like me, you already own them. The draw here are two concerts:you get a CD of an excellent show from Nashville in 1995 that featured guests likeEmmylou Harris and you get a DVD of the MTV special To Hell And Back in whichEarle completes some of his parole obligations by giving a concert at the Cold CreekCorrectional Facility. That's all too brief (the entire special is 45 minutes long) buttogether they show what a solid live performer he is and the remarkable catalog ofsongs he can draw upon.
AT
LONG
LAST
LOVE
($24.99 BluRay; Fox) 
PERFECT UNDERSTANDING  ($34.99
BluRay; Cohen Film Collection)OF HUMAN BONDAGE  ($29.99 BluRay;
Kino/Library Of Congress) -- Has there everbeen a bootleg version of a major film hidingin plain sight? That's the remarkable story
behind this new definitive director's edition of</p>
<p>Peter Bogdanovich's musical At Long Last
Love. His career took off with threemasterpieces: The Last Picture Show, Paper
Moon  and What's Up Doc  -- only to be
derailed by Daisy Miller, At Long Last Loveand Nickelodeon . never to fully recover. He
made some good films later but nothingremotely as important as those three gems.
But his Cole Porter musical was a sore spot
since Bogdanovich felt rushed and didn't
have time to edit carefully and create the
movie he knew he'd filmed. But again and
again over the years he'd hear from fans
praising it and wondering why it was so
critically lambasted. When he finally watched the version that had been circulating on
TV and cable for years, Bogdanovich was astonished to realize a studio exec had
created his own bootleg version of the film that hewed much more closely to
Bogdanovich's original vision and which was far superior to the theatrical version thatplayed in theaters and was booed by many critics. The entire tale is told in this columnfor Indiewire and now that it's out on BluRay we can judge for ourselves afresh if thisis an interesting mess, a failure or an unappreciated gem.
Few would claim greatness for Perfect Understanding, but the combination of talent
makes this irresistible for movie buffs. You get Gloria Swanson (a great talent nowovershadowed by her final Grand Guignol performance in Sunset Blvd) along withLaurence Olivier in a romantic comedy scripted by the brilliant Michael Powell. Withthat pedigree the result is a little disappointing but interesting nonetheless.
Perfect Understanding was the only film Swanson made in Great Britain. Bette Davis
didn't travel there to make Of Human Bondage. She just went from Warner Bros.
where she was under contract to the low-rent RKO. Why they wanted the unknown
Davis to play a Cockney waitress who hypnotizes the ever-bland Leslie Howard isbeyond understanding. But Davis made the most of her chance, overacting withabandon and setting off fireworks and juggling and doing anything else she couldpossibly do to say "Look at me!!!!" It worked and she became a star forever. I'll alwayscherish her melodramatic line reading of disgust when she tells Howard maniacally,"Abnd after you kissed me I always used to wipe my mouth. WIPED my mouth!" Evenwhen going over the top, you can't help watching her.</p>

WILFRED THE</p>
<p>COMPLETE
ORIGINAL SERIES  ($29.99 DVD; Shout)
WILFRED SEASON TWO  ($39.99 BluRay; Fox) -- The crown
of "Best Show On TV" gets passed around like a whiskey
bottle at a rodeo. But for a few weeks earlier this year when it
aired on Sundance, that crown belonged to Rectify . Calling a
series the quietest show on television isn't exactly a quote
they'll put in an ad campaign, but that's one of the signalpleasures of this drama. It's about Daniel Holden (a great
Aden Young) who was put into prison for the brutal murder of
his girlfriend and spent the next 19 years facing potential
execution, only to be released because DNA evidence now
clouds the issue of his guilt. Some people think he's still
guilty, others (precious few) think he's innocent or are willing
to move on and the other people involved on that horrible night suddenly realize their
actions may come back to haunt them. What's great about these episodes is that thisshow is not strictly or wholly about whether he's innocent and who really killed hisgirlfriend. Mostly it's focused on Daniel and how he's trying to adapt to life outside ofprison after spending his entire adult life in a brutal, indifferent environment. He'squiet, intelligent and seriously screwed up because that's what prison will do to you.Pacing his small bedroom (following the same path he did when pacing in his cell),making a half-hearted grasp at religion for solace, awkwardly trying to reconnect withfamily members all provide intense drama. Simply going to a corner store where kidsgiggle and take his picture with their cell phones is enough to befuddle and unnerveDaniel and that's exactly the sort of drama -- subtle, smart, real -- that Rectify  is
exploring. The cast is generally excellent (with the notable exception that his sisterplayed by Abigail Spencer looks an escaped Victoria's Secret model) and the showserious in its intent to stay right with Daniel and see the world through his eyes. Greatstuff.
For years now, Breaking Bad  has been tagged as not just the best drama on TV but
one of the best of all time. It's barreling towards its final episodes just in time. Season
Five upset those who hated to see their chemistry teacher become such a brutal thug.Certainly Walter White (Bryan Cranston) is less interesting as a straight-on baddie butthat's the entire point of the show. You can't be a drug lord with good intentions. Eitheryou fail and you die or you thrive and become a monster. I'm eager to see the finalbatch of shows before making up my mind about the overall arc of the series. Butwhat a cast and what a fresh drama it's been.
I'm still not sold on House Of Cards  starring Kevin Spacey. The American series is
still overshadowed in my imagination by the UK original, though I think it's slowly
finding its own way. Still, there's no question Netflix has delivered a quality drama anychannel would be proud to have on their own. If you didn't binge view when it waslaunched, now's your chance.
Another notable political drama is Borgen  from Denmark. Season 1 of this tale of the
first female head of that small country took off like a rocket. Unfortunately, it ended
with one of the bedrock pleasures of the show -- her warm family life -- being
upended in an unconvincing, unexpected divorce. The more real the show remains,
the more focused on the day to day business of running the country, the better. When
it gets caught up in conspiracies and elaborate plots, it becomes far less interesting.
Season two is still good -- the cast led by the very appealing Sidse Babett Knudsenas the Prime Minister and the sexy Pilou Asbaek as her spin doctor -- but it'sfascinating to see how the lack of a centered home life throws the heart of the showoff a lot. They ended it after season three and you can already see why, though fanswill certainly not be disappointed to a great degree.
The Newsroom  is a blue chip series with a cow chip reputation at the moment.
Creator Aaron Sorkin had the ideal platform with The West Wing  because the
president is supposed  to use his bully pulpit to expound on the issues of the day. That
same sensibility seemed silly on Sports Night . He seemed to alight on another great
environment for what he does best but somehow The Newsroom  was too self-
satisfied. Sorkin admits there's fixing to be done so maybe Season Two will be better.
And I just heard from two friends who defend it strongly, thanks in no small part to thecast led by Jeff Daniels. (You gotta love any show smart enough to cast JohnGallagher.) But to me it still feels like homework.
Costume dramas just say PBS to me and the original Masterpiece Theatre
blockbuster The First Churchills  typifies what makes that such a happy combination:
you get John Neville and Susan Hampshire in winning form playing the madly in loveSarah jennings and military genius John Churchill. Toss in decades of British history,royal pageantry and discrete sexual hijinks and most MT buffs will be happy as clams.This is proof they were getting it done right from the start.
I am not so enthusiastic about the latest PBS smash hit Call The Midwife.  Season
Two made clear once and for all that this was not going to blossom into a solid drama
but happily settle for melodrama and nice little crises that resolve themselves by the
end of each episode. It's a soap opera, pure and simple and my mother loves it so</p>
<p>who am I to abuse her? Still, I can't respect a heroine who spurns the delightful
George Rainsford as Jimmy; it doesn't help that actress Jessica Raine is the weakest
of the bunch and each emotion must be telegraphed by her face every single time.What really keeps me watching is the wonderful Miranda Hart as Chummy, a blue-blood who wants to be useful. Spin-off, please!
I'm a huge fan of Elijah Wood (he's talented, handsome and has great taste in music,
so what's not to like) and his stoner comedy Wilfred  about a guy who thinks his
neighbor's dog is talking to him keeps me tuning in. Season Two was about as solidas season one, though I prefer when the show is sweet and the dog not quite somanipulative. They should be helping each other, not fighting each other. Catching
the original Australian series is trippy. It's got the same vibe, the same level of thc and
often the same basic storylines. But since I saw the American version first and they
captured the spirit of the series so well, I have the weird feeling the original Aussieshow is ripping off the remake. Whoa! Someone call Bill & Ted; I think I just blew mymind.
