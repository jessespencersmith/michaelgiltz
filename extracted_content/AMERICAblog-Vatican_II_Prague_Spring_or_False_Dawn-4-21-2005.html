4/21/2005 03:08:00 AMI'm finally ready to post again after the shock of hearingCardinal Ratzinger named the new Pope. Now I have to decideif the Catholic Church still embodies the promise of Vatican II.Was the mid Sixties a Prague Spring in the Church -- a periodof openness that has inspired a backlash but will ultimatelyprevail? Or was it a false dawn, portending nothing but arespite on the road to fundamentalism? I know what answerRatzinger would give -- and was ever anyone in the Churchgiven such a foreboding, Dickensian name as he?
