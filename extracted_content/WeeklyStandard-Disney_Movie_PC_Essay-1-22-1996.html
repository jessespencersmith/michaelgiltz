            <p>DISNEY'S DESECRATIONS 
We've entered a new golden 
age for the family film. 
Almost every major stu­
dio has a division devoted to creat­
ing live-action movies for kids, and 
1995 saw the release of at leas t three 
such films that will one day be con­
sidered classics: Babe, A Little 
Princess, and The Secret of Roan 
Inish. Only Babe did well at the box 
office, but all three will make a for­
tune when they are released as 
videos. Kids love to hear the same 
stories told over and over again in 
the same way, and parents love to 
plop the kids in front of the 
TV for an hour and a half of 
relative peace. So sales are 
booming; even commercial 
and creative flops, like the 
flaccid remake of Miracle on 
34th Street, can sell truckloads . 
Any Hollywood boom fea­
tures an immense amount of 
dross along with the gold, and 
the great irony of the current 
creative resurgence of the 
live-action family movie is 
the fact that not a single good 
one in recent years has come 
from the foremost brand 
name there is: Disney. While stu­
dio after studio tries and fails to 
match the intelligence and craft of 
Disney's animated films, Disney's 
live-action movies for children 
have been abysmal. Worse yet, the 
studio has faltered by foraging 
through texts of classic children's 
literature and wreaking havoc on 
them. From Mark Twain to Rud­
yard Kipling, great works have 
been desecrated, sometimes to 
ensure they conform to Hollywood

ideology, and sometimes just 
because their makers and produc­
ers are remarkably bereft of taste 
and judgment. Babe, A LittLe 
Prillcess, and The Secret of Roan 
Inish are also derived from books of 
some distinction. But while they 
never shy away from the cold hard 
truths at the heart of their stories, 
the Disney adaptations show a level 
of disrespect for literature that stu­
dios usually reserve only for audi­
ences. When filmmakers try to 
skirt the prickly truths of these sto­
ries, they rob the tales of dramatic 
Tom alld I-luck: Never Mark 7Ivaill shalllllcct 
power and inadvertently hold up a 
mirror to their own prejudices and 
failings. 
Consider The Jungle Book. First 
turned into a cutesy cartoon by 
Disney in the 1960s-hardly a 
memorable effort apart from Phil 
Harris's singing "The Bare Neces­
sities"-Kipling's stories of a boy 
raised among the animals of India 
was again made into a movie by the 
studio last year. Kipling has, of 
course, fallen severely out of favor 
because he was unapologetically 
fond of colonialism and sometimes 
condescendingly fond of India and 
its people. Though little of this can be found in his tales about Mowgli, 
Disney denudes them of their 
insight and originality anyway. 
In the Disney version, Mowgli is 
a sweet and innocent creature who 
plays and frolics with his animal 
friends. White men are evil and 
stupid or at best benignly foolish. 
Though he attempts to join human 
society, it's deeply distasteful to 
him. Looking at a stuffed tiger in a 
trophy room, Mowgli says, "The 
more I learn what is a man, the 
more I want to be an animal." At 
the climax, he peacefully faces 
down the tiger Shere Khan, 
reporting proudly, "Shere 
Khan sees me not as a man, 
but a creature of the jungle." 
None of this has a thing to 
do with what Kipling wrote. 
Shere Khan, for example, is 
an almost mythically evil 
presence in the stories and 
constantly on the lookout for 
a chance to murder Mowgli. 
And at the climax of 
Kipling's tales, Mowgli glee­
fully lays a trap for Shere 
Khan and kills him. Revenge 
isn't just a fact of life in the 
jungle to Kipling, it is a noble pur­
suit in and of itself. Kipling's jun­
gle isn't an idyllic Eden separate 
and better than the world of man; it 
mirrors the world of man, complete 
with pettiness, kindness, anger, 
friendship, hatred, and sacrifice. 
Mowgli survives and rules over this 
world not despite the fact that he's 
human but because he's human­
none of the other animals can even 
look him in the eye for more than a 
moment. In the end, Mowgli joins 
the world of man because that's 
where he belongs. 
Disney distorts and dilutes Mark 
Twain's undeniably progressive

worldview just as thoroughly as it 
does Kipling's colonial ideology. 
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn 
generally scares the bejesus out of 
filmmakers, because it deals so 
forthrightly with slavery and the 
racial attitudes of the 19th century. 
But Disney's The Adventures of 
Huck Finn wouldn't even frighten 
Aunt Polly. Huck hangs out with 
the slaves and goes to Jim for 
advice. And who wouldn't? Jim is 
clearly far more intelligent and 
thoughtful than Huck, giving little 
speeches about equality and the 
evils of slavery. And when the two 
of them are rafting down the Mis­
sissippi, Jim always has a plan in 
mind or takes the time to teach 
Huck the difference between right 
and wrong. 
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is a 
far less controver sial novel, though 
even here Twain gently and persis­
tently mocks the conventions of 
society. But Tom and Huch, the new­
ly released Disney version of the 
book, still finds plenty to fiddle 
with. In the novel, Tom and Huck 
are basically equals. Still, while 
Tom takes special delight in Huck's 
notoriety, he won't go so far as to be 
seen with him in public. In the 
JANUARY 22,1996 movie, Tom is sweet and good, 
while Huck is generally bad-a 
selfish and scared coward (though 
the movie is quick to point out he 
was abused as a child by his drunk­
en Pap). Tom teaches Huck the 
importanc e of friendship with max­
ims like, "When a friend's in trou­
ble, you don't run away." Even 
minor characters like Becky 
Thatcher are perverted out of all 
reason; a willful, interesting girl­
child in the book, Becky becomes a 
distractingl y modern woman in the 
movie, pushing Tom into a creek at 
one point and punching him out at 
another. At the finale of Tom and 
Huch, Twain's intractable Huck 
jumps at the first opportunity to be 
"sivilized ." Tom is aghast when 
Huck talks excitedly about going to 
school before running off to escort 
the Widow Douglas to a church 
social. Perhaps the only real sur­
prise in this movie is that they 
didn't change the name of the bad 
guy: Injun Joe. 
These three fiascos teach a very 
interesting lesson about the 
dangers of tampering with the 
works of significant authors. For when filmmakers shy 
away from the complex 
and subtle characters 
of these classics, they 
often inadvertently in­
ject the ugly stereotype s 
they thought needed 
avoiding in the first 
place-vulgarities the ori­
ginal authors could never 
even Imagme. 
In the recent Jungle 
Book, for example, Mowgli 
easily outwits the white 
men. When he's captured, 
it's always by treacherous 
and black hearted Indians. 
Inadvertent message: The 
dark-skinned natives are 
even more wily and evil 
than the worst white peo-
ple. Kipling may have 
coined the phrase "white man's 
burden," but his ideas about the 
differences between the races were 
layered and ambiguous . If there 
were stereotypes in his works, they 
were balanced by complex, engag­
ing characters, such as the title role 
in his masterpiece Kim. No such 
balance exists here. 
In The Adventur es of Huch Finn, 
Twain's giddily optimistic finale is 
taken to even further extremes 
when the slave Jim is dressed to the 
nines and exchanging pleasantries 
with his former captors shortly 
after being freed. And throughout 
the film, even most of the slave 
owners are pictured as wonderfully 
concerned about their property and 
wracked with guilt about the whole 
arrangement . Inadvertent message: 
Slavery wasn't so bad, owners were 
generally good people, and every­
one was relieved when it was end­
ed. This, it goes without saying, is a 
travesty of the lessons of Twain's 
novel, one of the deepest explo­
rations of the idea of freedom in lit­
erature. 
In Tom and Huch, the newly 
modernized Becky endangers the 
safety of her and Tom by refusing' 
to heed his warnings not to yell at

<p>the top of her voice while they're in 
the caves outside town. Her willful 
heedlessness causes a cave-in that 
traps the two and almost costs them 
their lives. Inadvertent message: 
Girls should remember their place, 
especially when doing dangerou s 
things like exploring caves that are 
better left to the boys. 
Parents looking for "safe" enter-tainment for their kids should 
avoid these three movies and, until 
there's some suggestion the studio 
has learned the error of its ways, 
whatever live-action literary adap­
tations Disney attempts in the 
future. Mush is never part of a well­
balanced diet. And· well-inten­
tioned mush is the most unhealth­
ful mush of all. •</p>
