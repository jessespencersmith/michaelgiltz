21 Killed in Iraq and Dozens Hurt in Bomb
Attacks -- Iraqis Rejoice
by Michael in New York  on 6/15/2004 10:27:00 AM
More suicide bombers in Iraq, with coordinated strikes making it one
of the deadliest attacks in June. Many of the victims were foreign
contract workers and Iraqi civilians. The slightly buried, slightlydepressing headline: Iraqi citizens flooded the streets, danced on topof the cars that had been bombed, cheered, set them ablaze andeven waved a severed finger at the media recording their joy. Iraqisecurity forces -- who are more and more in charge of patrolling
Baghdad -- stood by and watched helplessly.
