            <p>DVDs:  Downton  Abbey   Fans  Better
Brace  Themselves
This week I cover the new season of Downton  Abbey  (without any spoilers), some new
releases including Adam Sandler's biggest hit in years, another excellent Criterion release,
a John Ford gem and a round-up of (mostly) British TV. Enjoy.
DOWNTON  ABBEY   SEASON  THREE
($54.99 BluRay; PBS) -- I won't spoil thenew season of Downton  Abbey  for you;
creator Julian Fellowes does that verynicely on his own, thank you very much.Those who can't bear to wait for theepisodes to air on American TV can rushout now and see the entire season,including the holiday special finale. I'lldiscuss the show once it has ended in theU.S. But it's no spoiler to say there will bemany twists and turns before the seasonends. Brace yourselves: not since the
season one finale of The  Killing  on AMC
or the "it was all a dream" lunacy on
Dallas  has a show worked so hard to alienate its fans. I think the main problem is that
Downton  Abbey  looks like a prestigious drama, has the trappings of a prestigious drama,
has the great cast of a prestigious drama and follows in the footsteps of one of TV's all-
time champs, Upstairs  Downstairs . Unfortunately, Downton  Abbey  is a daytime soap and
any possibility of character growth and development is squashed underneath the desire to
make you squeal over some unexpected change. Dramas allow you to explore a character,
a world, a relationship. Soaps simply leave you wondering what happens next. I thinkseason three was a huge improvement over season two, in which characters behavedidiotically and completely out of touch with who they are. But it leaves no doubt thatanyone hoping for greatness will have to settle for far, far less.

<p>a smart actor who knows how to make
movies at a reasonable cost and usuallydelivers an audience. Sometimes they
misfire commercially, like the
misbegotten That's  My  Boy . More often
they misfire creatively but still pull in an
audience, like   Jack  And  Jill  or Grown
Ups (which has a sequel in the works).
But life must be most enjoyable whenSandler can enjoy the rare film that getspretty good reviews and strong box office.The animated film Hotel  Transylvania  is
his biggest worldwide hit yet and actuallyhas a little heart to it. It's not as rich asParaNorman  (the vaguely similar film
that also came out last year), but by Godit's not the train wreck that Jack  And  Jillwas.
Tim Burton expands his breakthrough
short film Frankenweenie  for no good
reason in this stop-motion black andwhite feature. Why he bothered is hard todetermine. All the charm of the moviecan be enjoyed simply by watching theshort. And nothing much is gained. True,it's like manna from heaven compared tothe witless Dark  Shadows.  But it does
emphasize how bereft of inspiration he
seems. Burton's two best films since his
debut with PeeWee's  Big  Adventure  -- the
dramas Ed  Wood  and Edward
Scissorhands  -- were entirely original.
Ever since he's remade movies, folk tales,musicals and books, all to diminishing
returns. Here's hoping he takes some time off to recharge and find something that trulyinspires him.
Inspiration is no problem for director Michel Ocelot, who follows his animated
masterpiece Azur  &  Asmar  from 2009 with a sweetly diverting collection of tales. Like in
his earlier collection of stories called Princes  &  Princesses , a teacher and two students
gather in an abandoned cinema and create a string of fairy tales, such as the story of ayoung man who stumbles into the realm of the dead and wins the hand of the princessand the story of a villager who believes he's been given a magic drum and uses its rhythmsto save his people from warriors. Each tale is told in vibrant colors and a silhouette styleof cutouts that is surprisingly effective and shows us how rich the world of animation canbe. Only the lack of progression in the relationship of the boy and girl who tell thesestories keep this from being as great as Azur  &  Asmar,  but it's delightful all the same.</p>
<p>SEARCHING  FOR  SUGARMAN
($35.99 BluRay; Sony) -- Like so manydocumentaries today, this ramshacklework has a very interesting story that isn'tmatched with any particular filmmakingskill. They also play fast and loose withthe details of Sixto Rodriguez, a 1970srecording artist who delivered some verygood music and then sank into obscurity,never realizing he'd become a superstar ofsorts in South Africa. The film sort ofglides over the fact that his revival tookplace in the 1990s (meaning the movie israther late to the game of rediscoveringRodriguez) and that he'd already been
rediscovered in Australia in the late 1970s and early 1980s (even opening for Midnight Oiland recording a live album). Still, it's a good reminder of how fickle fame can be since
Rodriguez clearly had the goods. He's reportedly considering making a new album and has
30 or so songs ready to go, so perhaps this latest rediscovery will finally stick.
IVAN'S  CHILDHOOD  ($39.95 BluRay)
-- Like Ingmar Bergman, director Andrei
Tarkovsky has an austere, intimidating
reputation. Those who started with his
final work The  Sacrifice  may have never
ventured beyond it. But the clever Steven
Soderbergh remake of Solaris and this
debut feature from Tarkovsky himself
may give adventurous filmgoers a chance
to rediscover this Russian master.
Focused on a young boy, it shows himdealing with the horrendous nightmare ofWorld War II while flashing back to lifebefore the war which now seems almostimpossibly ideal. Remember, the Soviet
Union bled for the war like no other country; military losses alone were about 10 millionwith another 13 million in civilian deaths, dwarfing everyone else. This film is beautifullyshot and heart-rending, easily his most accessible. Extras include several essays,interviews with scholars, the cinematographer Vadim Yusov and star Nikolai Burlyaev.Most importantly, the film looks terrific.
HOW  GREEN  WAS  MY  VALLEY($24.99 BluRay; FOX)WHITE  ZOMBIE  ($24.95 DVD; Kino)
THE  DUELLISTS  ($19.97 BluRay;
Shout Factory)THAT  OBSCURE  OBJECT  OFDESIRE  ($29.99 BluRay; Lionsgate)</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN'S  AGREEMENT
($24.99 BluRay; FOX)WILD  RIVER  ($24.99 BluRay; FOX) --
John Ford's How  Green  Was  My  Valleyis studio filmmaking at its finest. It's anintelligent adult story but also quiteaccessible to kids thanks to the characterplayed by Roddy McDowall that is at theheart of the film. When war preventedthem from filming this story in Wales,they simply built a massive set in theSanta Monica Mountains and the Welshthemselves probably wondered what localtown it was shot in. The sound of themining disaster alarm still sends shivers.Sentimental, heart-tugging to be sure, buttold with restraint and craftsmanship of
the highest level. A real champ.
It was only 1932, but Bela Lugosi already
felt the weight of his breakthroughperformance as Dracula haunting hiscareer. He would only ever enjoy real
artistic success in horror films but they
didn't all have to be variations on that
role. Case in point: White  Zombie . This
super low budgeter set in Haiti letsLugois put his inimitable stamp on thezombie genre. It's great to see a 6 minute
clip of Lugosi being interviewed at the
time and historian Frank Thompson puts
the film in context. I'm not quite surewhy they included the entire unrestoredversion of the film as well as the cleanestdigital copy they could achieve. Surely aclip or two would be enough todemonstrate the work they did. But itmakes no matter; this zombie flick showshow much could be made with little.
Somehow I have no problem with British
actors playing, say, Russians. (In fact, ithappens so often I'm sometimessurprised when Russians don't haveBritish accents.) But Americans playingFrench? It just strikes me as absurd,whether it's Kirk Douglas foolishlypretending to be French in StanleyKubrick's Paths  Of  Glory  or Harvey Keitel
and Keith Carradine posing asFrenchmen in The  Duellists . Still there's
no denying Ridley Scott's visual flair; thisis a gorgeous looking movie to rivalanother Kubrick film, Barry  Lyndon .
Scott offers a commentary track but Iespecially appreciate the chance to hearcomposer Howard Blake weigh in on hiscontributions. Composers and</p>
<p>cinematographers and set designers often
are far less circumspect and self-censoring than directors and therefore alot more fun.
I'm simply not a Luis Bunuel fan but if
you're going to talk about world cinemayou simply must tackle some of his keywork, including his final film ThatObscure  Object  Of  Desire , an Oscar-
nominated comic drama about sexualobsession presented here in a fine BluRayprint.
Gentleman's  Agreement  by director Elia
Kazan is a woefully earnest film I found a
bit heavy-handed even the first time Isaw it as a 12-year-old. Gregory Peckdiscovers how different the world is when
he starts to pretend he is Jewish for a magazine article on anti-Semitism. The making ofthe film is far more interesting than the film itself. Most studio chiefs were Jewish andavoided Jewish themed films like the plague (they thought assimilating meant ignoringtheir roots) and were truly wary of the bestselling book that inspired the movie. Complainabout anti-Semitism? When it was made anyway, they offered to buy it from FOX so they
could lock it away forever. But the film went on to much success and won the Oscar for
Best Film.
Director Elia Kazan went on to direct Wild  River  some 15 years later. It gets lost in the
shuffle of his bigger movies and personally I find it sad to watch the always subtly sad
actor Montgomery Clift in his post-accident phase. But the story of a government agent
who must clear out a small town so a dam can be built is low-key drama of the sortstudios rarely tackle anymore and Martin Scorsese, for one, considers it one of Kazan'sneglected gems.

FIRST  SEASON  ($29.98 DVD; EOne)
WODEHOUSE  PLAYHOUSECOMPLETE  COLLECTION  ($59.99
DVD; Acorn)DOCTOR  WHO:  SHADA  ($39.98
DVD; BBC) -- Can you have too muchHercule Poirot or Miss Marple? No, Idon't suppose you can. However, I'm notquite sure who this collection will appealto. It contains greatest hits (selected byfans) of both Poirot (played by DavidSuchet) and not one but two Marples(assayed by Geraldine McEwan and JuliaMcKenzie). Now, many people enjoydetectives but they usually have a favoriteand when it comes to their favorite theydefinitely have a favorite actor theyprefer. That doesn't stop them fromwatching each and every version, mindyou. But this sort of set seems designed tostart arguments. Serious arguments thatmight turn into rows that might lead to...murder. For those willing to risk it, youget 11 mysteries totaling about 16 hours in
all.
I've never been entirely sold on Being
Human , the high concept comic drama
which features young people who just
happen to be a ghost, a werewolf and a
vampire coming together as roomies. But
the British version is superior to theAmerican remake. Season Four is a hardhurdle even for hardcore fans since manyactors were ready to move on. You'vebeen warned.
Misfits  is another British import. I'm kind
of astonished this show hasn't been
remade in the U.S. yet, focusing as it doeson teens blessed with unexpected powers.In this season a masked hero or threat ishovering over the gang. The show is</p>
<p>already into its fourth season so the DVDs
are lagging behind a bit. There's even afeature film in the works.
Sometimes you just want pulpy fun and
that's what the undemanding Cinemaxanthology series Femme  Fatales  has on
top. Spot the babe with the smoking gunon the cover and you know what toexpect. Happily, the series modestly out-delivers. Tanit Phoenix is the host, settingup each episode's storyline and thenstepping in at the end to wrap it up (notto mention popping in during some talesto push the plot along). You get someclever overlap from one episode to thenext with a minor character here takingcenter stage there. Gratuitous sex isdependably available in each episode andmost of the time, to be fair, the storiesare a little rote. But it's just good enoughin its way to make you wish they'd aimeven higher. Or is that lower?
Now, it's not truly possible to read only
P.G. Wodehouse and only watch Stephen
Fry and Hugh Laurie in the TV series
Jeeves  &  Wooster . I know; I've tried.
Eventually life must move on. That's when
you dive into Wodehouse  Playhouse , a
British series from the 1970s that adaptednon-Jeeves and Wooster stories in ananthology series starring Pauline Collinsand her husband John Alderton (Thomas
of the original Upstairs,  Downstairs ). The pilot has been lost but the remaining 20
episodes are here. If you enjoy this sort of nonsense, it really only works well when doneby the Brits. Best of all, Wodehouse himself intros the first seven episodes.
I can't believe I'm starting to agree with those who insist that Matt Smith may be even
better than David Tennant as the Doctor. But my first Doctor -- Tom Baker -- will alwaysbe the one who pops to mind when I read that character's name. Here's one of the moremysterious adventures from his reign that lasted from 1974-1981, famously the only talenever to be finished. The BBC offers very admirable and engaging extras on these DoctorWho  reissues: this set is truly loaded with the story of why this tale never ended, a 90
minute documentary on the show, a 27 minute short on how labor strikes have affectedthe show in general and much more. Still, I long for a complete boxed set for everyDoctor. Someday...</p>
