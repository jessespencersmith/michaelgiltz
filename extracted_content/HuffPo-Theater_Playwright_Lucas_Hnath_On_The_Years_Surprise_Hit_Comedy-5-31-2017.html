Theater: Playwright Lucas Hnath On The Year's
Surprise Hit Comedy
05/31/2017 01:52 am ET  | Updated  May 31, 2017
The good news keeps coming for the goofily titled A Doll’s House, Part 2 , a witty and unexpected sequel to 
Henrik Ibsen’s sobering classic. First, the Broadway debut of playwright Lucas Hnath enjoyed some of the 
best reviews of the year. That’s no small feat since other shows opening include the Pulitzer Prize-winning drama Sweat , Indecent  by Paula Vogel (a Pulitzer Prize-winner herself) and Lincoln Center’s justly acclaimed 
transfer of Oslo . Second, A Doll’s House, Part 2  garnered eight Tony nominations, more than any other play 
this year. Third, it made history by getting a Best Play nod — this is the first time all the nominees are American playwrights making their Broadway debut. (Indeed, it seems to be the only  time all nominees for 
Best Play were making their Broadway debut, whatever country they hail from.)
Most importantly, A Doll’s House, Part 2  is becoming an honest-to-goodness word-of-mouth hit. Sure, it’s 
got the star power of Emmy winner Laurie Metcalf, film star Chris Cooper, recent Tony winner Jayne 
Houdyshell and the rising talent Condola Rashad.  And sure, people have heard  of A Doll’s House,  the 
landmark Norwegian drama that showed Nora turning her back on the institution of marriage by slamming the door on hearth and home at its infamous finale. But just because they’ve heard of it doesn’t mean they’ve actually seen it. And would they want to see a sequel about what happens when Nora returns 15 years later?

Laurie Metcalf, Jayne Houdyshell, Condola Rashad, and Chris Cooper star in LucasHnath's A Doll's House, Part 2 .
Not to worry — you don’t need to know a thing about the original to savor the biting and bitingly funny 
recriminations and justifications and rationalizations that arise in the wake of a marriage disintegrating. And audiences are getting the word. The musical Come from Away  came out of nowhere to build and build every 
week until it joined the million dollar club of hit musicals. Now Hnath’s 90 minute boxing match of a comedy is doing the same: audiences and grosses are rising almost performance by performance since it began previews in April. They didn’t even miss a beat at the box office when staging a raucous midnight show to benefit the Actor’s Fund. 
That was a masterstroke of goodwill by producer Scott Rudin (who at least approved of it, if he didn’t originate
 
the idea himself). And his gamble in bringing this unlikely show straight to Broadway is paying off: Oslo  and A 
Doll’s House, Part 2  are in a dead heat for Best Play. But no matter what happens on Tony night (and Metcalf 
at the very least deserves Best Actress for her ferocious and funny command of the stage), it marks Hnath as 
a talent who has fully arrived. 
Lucas Hnath has been on the radar of anyone paying attention for years now. He burst onto the scene at the 
Humana Festival in 2012, where then New York Times critic Charles Isherwood championed him. Since then Hnath (pronounced NAY-th) has enjoyed a seemingly classic career path from festivals to regional productions to Off Off Broadway and up. He created a stir in New York when his terrific play Isaac’s Eye  
opened at the tiny Ensemble Studio Theatre in 2013. That same year, New York saw A Public Reading Of An</p>
<p>Unproduced Screenplay About The Death Of Walt Disney  with some bigger talent attached. 
Then in 2015, his drama The Christians  opened Off Broadway. That was followed in 2016 by the even more 
ambitious staging of Red Speedo , the story of an Olympic swimmer accused of taking performance enhancing  
drugs, a play that included a swimming pool in its set design. Every step of the way, Hnath’s work has been 
praised, analyzed and compared to the likes of Michael Frayn and Tom Stoppard, two other playwrights who can turn unlikely subject matter into popular entertainment. And now he’s on Broadway, becoming a (hard to pronounce) household name.
In this exclusive interview, Hnath talks about his childhood in Florida and how living in a geodesic dome 
influenced his writing. He discusses the ten years he spent writing plays when no one cared, working in isolation late into the night after a day job working for a legal aid non-profit. Hnath labored over show after show, even though he couldn’t get anyone to read them, much less perform them. Then when that first break came and producers asked, “What else have you got?” the answer was a stack of plays, much like Martin McDonagh burst onto the theatrical scene in the 1990s with a seemingly endless supply of good to great dramas. Now, instead of the pressure of having to believe you’re a playwright when no one mounts your plays, Hnath faces the happy pressures of media attention and the bigger stage of Broadway. What else has he got? We’re about to find out.
You can see the 28 min. interview at the bottom of this story. If you’re already a fan, you might prefer the 
longer, 46 min version. And if you’re already a genuine Hnathian fanatic, check out the complete, unedited 83 min interview  including hems and haws and awkward pauses (mostly on my part). First I’ve included some 
highlights.
