            <p>W E D N E S D AY,  O C TO B E R  1 1 ,  2 0 0 6Fall TV RoundupTonight is the debut of "30 Rock" and the John Lithgow comedy, thelast of the significant fall premieres. (I haven't seen advances.) Everynetwork has already made a flurry of changes, but I'll still take amoment to give my rundown.NEW SHOWS YOU SHOULD WATCH:1. Friday Night Lights -- the second episode did everything I hoped for:it began at Sunday service (where a new football coach would have toappear and which made emotional sense since the local starquarterback had just been paralyzed in a terrible on-field accident).And the show ended with the kickoff of the Friday night game, meaningthey're not wedded to showing the actual games. What matters are thecharacters and it's a great mix, from the paralyzed quarterback and hisgirlfriend, to the deer-in-the-headlights replacement, the drunk player,the brash talking black kid (the closest to a cliche on the show buthopefully he'll deepen), the coach who fears for his job (played by KyleChandler in the role of his career) and the constant din of the townsfolkwho offer advice everywhere he turns. This is nuanced, gripping,emotional, subtle and wonderful stuff. And again, it's nice to see peoplewho pray appear on TV who aren't freaks or polygamists or hypocrites.This show is in ratings trouble so the sooner you start watching thebetter. NBC would be foolish to dump this one.2. Heroes -- the last thing I wanted was another serialized drama in mylife (but are serialized dramas really any more of a commitment than,say, "Grey's Anatomy?"). But this one is goofy fun. Long term, I'mworried about them teasing this out or wondering if they'll have a newoverall adventure each season or what. In short, I have no idea what'sgoing on but all the characters (except the cartoonist who can paint thefuture) are interesting. I'd like to stop watching, but can't.3. The Nine -- only seen one episode, but I thought the pilot was great.Lots of good characters. As long as they don't dwell in the past (whathappened during that bank robbery???) this could be good.WHEN DOES ONE PLUS ONE EQUAL .8?That would be when you merge the WB and UPN into CW.
