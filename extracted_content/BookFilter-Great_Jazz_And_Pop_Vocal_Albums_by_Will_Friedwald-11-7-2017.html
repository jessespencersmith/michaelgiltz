From the Publisher: The author of the magisterial  A Biographical Guide to
the Great Jazz and Pop Singers  now approaches the great singers and their
greatest work in an innovative and revelatory way: through consideringtheir finest  albums,  which is the format in which this music was most
resonantly organized and presented to its public from the 1940s until thevery recent decline of the CD. It is through their albums that Ella
Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Sarah Vaughan, Nat King Cole, Judy
Garland, and the rest of the glorious honor roll of jazz and pop singershave been most tellingly and lastingly appreciated, and the history of thealbum itself, as Will Friedwald sketches it, can now be seen as a crucialpart of musical history. We come to understand that, at their finest,
albums have not been mere collections of individual songs strung together
arbitrarily but organic phenomena in their own right. A Sinatra album, aFitzgerald album, was planned and structured to show these artists attheir best, at a specific moment in their artistic careers. Yet the albumsFriedwald has chosen to anatomize go about their work in a variety of
ways. There are studio and solo albums: Lee’s  Black Coffee,  June
Christy’s  Something Cool,  Cassandra Wilson’s  Belly of the Sun.  There are
brilliant collaborations: famous ones—Tony Bennett and Bill Evans, Louis
Armstrong and Oscar Peterson—and wonderful surprises like Doris Day and
Robert Goulet singing  Annie Get Your Gun . There are theme albums—
Dinah Washington singing Fats Waller, Maxine Sullivan singing Andy Razaf,
Margaret Whiting singing Jerome Kern, Barb Jungr singing Bob Dylan, andthe sublime Jo Stafford singing American and Scottish folk songs. Thereare also stunning concert albums like Ella in Berlin, Sarah in Japan, Lena
at the Waldorf, and, of course,  Judy at Carnegie Hall.  All the greats are
on hand, from Kay Starr and Carmen McRae to Jimmy Scott and Della
Reese ( Della Della Cha Cha Cha ). And, from out of left field, the
astounding  God Bless Tiny Tim.    Each of the fifty-seven albums discussed
here captures the artist at a high point, if not at the expected moment,of her or his career. The individual cuts are evaluated, the sequencingexplicated, the songs and songwriters heralded; anecdotes abound of howsongs were born and how artists and producers collaborated. And in
appraising each album, Friedwald balances his own opinions with those of
musicians, listeners, and critics. A monumental achievement,  The Great
Jazz and Pop Vocal Albums  is an essential book for lovers of American jazz
and popular music.

What We Say
It's taken me 40+ hours and counting to review this career capper of a book by music critic Will Friedwald. Not because it's
so long, but because every time he talks about an album, I can't help but cue up a CD or download the music via a
streaming app and start listening. Proudly, I'd say two-thirds of the time I'm revisiting a classic album I love, like Sinatra's"In The Wee Small Hours" or Louis Armstrong's "Meets Oscar Peterson." But thanks to Friedwald's enthusiasm, I've alsolistened to some great albums I've never heard before. The excuse for all this fun is a sort of desert island discs roundup of
his favorites, from Carmen McRae and Ella Fitzgerald to offbeat choices like Tiny Tim (!) and Della Reese's contribution to
the Latin craze. imagine if Friedwald were asked to provide liner notes to the reissue of any of these albums and you'll geta sense of what he's doing. From artist to artist, Friedwald varies his insights, ranging from the songwriters an artist workedwith to the cheapskate managers that hurt their recordings (Armstrong was usually asked to record his albums late at nightAFTER doing a full concert and thus vocally exhausted) to the perennial mystery of how Doris Day is under-appreciated by
so many, starting with Day herself. (Friedwald has made me gaga over her albums "Day By Day" and "Day By Night" and
especially the where-have-you-been-all-my-life masterpiece that is her studio recording of the songs from "Annie Get YourGun" alongside Robert Goulet.) Friedwald has always been a reliable and informative guide to the great jazz and pop vocalalbums that flourished especially in the 1950s. I happily agreed with some choices and argued with others (I'm still not sold
on Eydie Gormé and Steve Lawrence) but thanks to streaming sites, almost anyone can sample the music right away and
hear for themselves. The only way I could enjoy this more is if I had Friedwald there to debate with and enthuse over somuch great music. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
"Will Friedwald's thoughtful analysis and insight into the background and nuances of the music by the artists
featured in his book make each song a more enriching experience for casual listeners and music aficionadosalike. I'm honored to be included and grateful to Will for keeping the American Songbook and jazz classicsrelevant for generations to come." —Doris Day “Absolutely indispensable . . . Friedwald . . . brings his rare abilityto write about singing in a way that effectively bridges impressionistic interpretation with musical analysis to the
task of ‘reading’ an album the way a literary critic reads a poem. The result is never less than perceptive and
often stop-in-your tracks brilliant . . . . A magnificent achievement.” —Bill Ott, Booklist (starred review) "Withverve and an infectious love of music, jazz critic Friedwald tells the stories of fifty-seven jazz and pop albumsthat have become benchmarks by which subsequent records have been measured. . . . His passionate descriptionof each album in this indispensable guide will drive readers to listen to the albums once again, or for the firsttime." —Publishers Weekly, starred review
