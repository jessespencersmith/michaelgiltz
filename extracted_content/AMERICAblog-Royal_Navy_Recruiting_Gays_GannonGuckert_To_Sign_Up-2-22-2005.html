2/22/2005 10:06:00 PMThe US military continues to spend millions of dollars a yeartraining gay and lesbian soldiers and then millions more towitchhunt these brave Americans and kick them out. It'sdamaging national security, damaging our ability to projectpower around the world and -- given the absurd blackballing ofqueer specialists in Arabic languages -- could well stop us frompreventing the next 9-11.To prove how far behind we are, look at the British military:like almost every other Western democracy -- including Canadaand Israel -- they've stopped attacking soldiers who want toserve their country but happen to be gay. Now they're going astep further, with the Royal Navy set to actively recruit gays.So if JamesJeff GuckertGannon is looking to make a careerswitch, why not try the Royal Navy? Sure, he'd have to buyanother military uniform, but Guckert can always find otheruses for it.
