9/03/2005 03:00:00 PMChertoff just ended another ridiculous press conference.Thankfully, he's facing some tough questions. Here's whereChertoff unconsciously admits they are on trial in front of theAmerican people and being found guilty of incompetence andindifference. Chertoff insists New Orleans suffered two naturaldisasters -- the hurricane and the levee breaking -- and thatNO ONE could have ever anticipated both occurring at once,which is absurd. A reporter asked him why he couldn't haveanticipated both and Chertoff just responded:That's the kind of question which in court the judge usuallysustains the objection to. It's called argumentative. Butnevertheless...you know... if we had an atomic bomb ontop of this...and we could pile on catastrophes...wheneveryou do a planning process, you have to deal with what isreasonably foreseeable. It is true that you can sometimeshave a combination of things that are reasonablyforeseeable but that combination is unforeseeable.Huh? He is out of his mind. An atomic bomb? Chertoff is comparingpreparing for a category 4 hurricane and a levee break caused bythat hurricane to preparing for the absurd situation of a hurricaneAND an atomic bomb being set off. What an insanely ridiculouscomparison.We've seen their own mock games looking at what would happen andEVERYTHING that occurred has been foreseen. Chertoff is lying to theAmerican people when he says a hurricane overwhelming a levee andcausing it to break hasn't been foreseen.
