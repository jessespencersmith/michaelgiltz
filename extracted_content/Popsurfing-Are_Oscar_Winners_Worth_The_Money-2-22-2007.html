            <p>T H U R S D AY,  F E B R U A RY  2 2 ,  2 0 0 7Are Oscar Winners Worth The Money?Popsurfer Joe pointed me to this article on CNN about a study thatdecided casting Oscar winners in a new movie won't guaranteefinancial success. Well, duh. No one in their right minds would thinkan Oscar winner was a guarantee of financial success. In fact,NOTHING is a guarantee of financial success when making a movieand if there was such a formula, everyone would use it.This professor at Rutgers decided that having a "star" in your film --which he defined as being someone who had won an Oscar -- was onlymarginally helpful. First, any marginal help is welcome. Second, whodecided a "star" was someone who had won an Oscar. No, a "star" issomeone who sells tickets. Tom Cruise is a star. Eddie Murphy is a star.Julia Roberts was a star even before she won an Oscar for "ErinBrockovich." And so on. Winning an Oscar is nice. Being a star is betterand the two may occasionally cross paths, but they have nothingwhatsoever to do with each other.Then why does the price of someone who just won an Oscar go up?Because they've just been placed in front of tens of millions of movie-lovers and that can't hurt. But it's not everyone who wins an Oscar whosuddenly gets a huge paycheck. Many are glad just to keep working.And their choice to illustrate the study -- Jennifer Hudson -- is way off.Has Hudson's salary gone way up? Of course it has and rightly so. Isshe a proven box office commodity? Nope. But she was in the pivotalrole in the top-grossing black drama/musical OF ALL TIME. She hashuge awareness thanks to American Idol. And she's working on a debutalbum with top producers that will keep her in the spotlight a la J-Lo,regardless of how her next movie does. And in the right role, Hudson isdefinitely worth the $1 mil+ she'll get. Will it pan out? No one knows.But that would be money well spent.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
