6/13/2005 09:50:00 AMSenator Mel Martinez of Florida is the first top Republican tojoin the chorus of people who say Guantanamo Bay must beclosed.Meanwhile, the Washington Post makes an important point:closing Guantanamo Bay is a good symbolic step, but it will bemeaningless unless the US also takes further steps.The first step must be to impose legality and outsidecontrol on the most shameful part of the detentionsystem -- which is not Guantanamo Bay but the secretnetwork of detention facilities maintained by the CIA.The dozens (at least) of prisoners in this network,including the most important terrorist leaders, arebeing held without any legal process, outside review,family notification or monitoring by the InternationalRed Cross. Moreover, the administration has declaredthat such prisoners may be subjected to "cruel,inhuman and degrading" treatment, such as mockexecutions and simulated drowning, even though theUnited States has ratified an international treatyprohibiting such practices. It also insists on the rightto transport these prisoners to countries where tortureis practiced, again in contravention of internationallaw.All of these prisoners should be held in facilitiesoperated by the United States and visited by the RedCross; the grounds for their detention should besubject to regular outside review. When possible, theyshould be charged and tried. As is the case for allother detainees in American custody, treatment thatwould violate the U.S. Constitution should be illegal.In other words, treat prisoners the way we have ALWAYS treatedthem in the past, stay true to the values of America and a decentsociety and stop using the fight against terror as a reason to embracethe tactics of terror.
