<p>THE LORAX  ($34.98 BluRay combo; Universal) 
THE CAT IN THE HAT DELUXE EDITION  ($24.98 BluRay combo; Warner Bros.)
MY LITTLE PONY: ROYAL PONY WEDDING  ($14.97 DVD; Shout)
MIA AND THE MIGOO  ($19.98 DVD; EOne) -- Hollywood keeps making movies based on books by
Dr. Seuss and they keep sucking. It's not hard to understand why when you see something like the 85
minute, padded out Hollywood flick The Lorax  (complete with celeb voices like Zac Efron, Taylor Swift
and Betty White) side by side with The Cat In The Hat , the 1971 TV special that's a trim and tight 25
minutes and features voice actors like Allan Sherman, Daws Butler, Thurl Ravenscroft and other peopleyou've never heard of before. The Dr. Seuss books are typically 32 pages long (like most picture books)and contain very few words. Padding out those minimalist stories to feature length means adding inunnecessary chase scenes and subplots and other gilding that obscures the haiku-like masterpieces Seusscreated. Mind you, even keeping it short doesn't guarantee success; the TV special version of The Lorax
back in 1972 is better mostly because it's shorter than the film. The preachiness of one of Seuss's more
didactic books comes through even more clearly. But there's no question you'll get much more value outof watching and rewatching The Cat In The Hat  than the latest stab at puffing up a Seuss tale into a
movie. That won't stop kids from wanting to see them; if you've got a little girl, it's quite likely you've hadto endure My Little Pony . It's kind of cute that Royal Pony Wedding  is tied into the Royal Wedding but
comes out so long after Will and Kate tied the knot it seems sweetly out of step. But that's where thecuteness in this banal series ends. (Canterlot? Really?) Take a stab at a lesser known property and checkout Mia and the Migoo . It too has a nature-friendly tale, just like The Lorax, not to mention a star-heavy
cast including Whoopi Goldberg and Wallace Shawn. But the personal nature of this story and the care

<p>with which the hand-drawn animation was created make this far more distinctive and engaging. And if
your kid becomes crazy about it, you won't mind seeing it repeated a bazillion times so very much.
FOREVER MARILYN  ($99.98 BluRay; Fox) -- By now, the starlets who are famous for their breasts
and their pin-ups have been reduced to a few iconic images. The actresses with genuine talent and star
quality are remembered for their films. Hence this seven film collection of Marilyn Monroe which
contains five movies new to Bluray and yet still has fans asking why was this movie left out and why wasthat  movie left out and so on? At less than $15 per film, this is a modestly packaged set with a cardboard
case and those annoying sleeves in which you slide discs in and out and try not to scratch them. Butwhere it really matters -- the quality of the images on the discs themselves. Her greatest film -- SomeLike It Hot  -- looks as good as recent reissues. The bauble How To Marry A Millionaire  may be dated in
its would-be modern sensibility but that makes its essentially romantic heart even more endearing.There's No Business Like Show Business, River Of No Return  (with Robert Mitchum) and the truly dated
The Seven Year Itch  (a tiresome conceit that has not stood the test of time) are all fine looking and
Monroe looks even better and is the best thing in them. But her last completed film The Misfits  -- with
Monroe holding her own next to Clark Gable and Montgomery Clift -- shows Monroe maturingbeautifully. And Gentlemen Prefer Blondes  is just stunning. For those like me who prefer their movies in
compact cases rather than say a pink powder puff that you'd end up storing in your closet anyway, this is
a solid introduction to a major talent.

MARLEY  ($26.98 DVD; magnolia)

<p>HIGH FIDELITY  ($20 Bluray: Touchstone) -- Big Easy Express  is an all-too brief concert
film/documentary about a concert tour featuring Mumford & Sons, Edward Sharpe and Old Crow
Medicine Show, three simpatico bands drawing upon Americana. The gimmick was that they rode the
rails, traveling on a special train the entire way. It sounds like a blast. Unfortunately, for a fair amount of
the 66 minute film everyone keeps telling us what a great time they're having and/or expounds on the
meaning of it all. When the filmmaker stays in the corner and just observes everyone jamming, it's a
delight akin to Festival Express.  Modest highlights on this strictly for fans release include watching
Mumford & Sons rehearse with a high school marching band and then cutting to the live performance
where the kids are having the time of their lives, as well as a raucous finale on "Bound For Glory." Nexttime, more music please. Johnny Cash: We Walk The Line  is a tribute to the Man in Black. These shows
are a dime a dozen but the artists are especially focused and on their game, with Carolina Chocolate
Drops a delight on "Jackson" and Kris Kristofferson the magnetic elder statesman on a few numbers.
Also out are a string of nicely priced Cash compilations, led by The Number Ones  (which contains 19
hits), Duets, Gospel  and Country Classics.  Each is just $8 on their own and a good buy. Buy them all and
mix them up and you'll have a pretty good introduction but the uninitiated are still better off with a Sun
classics compilation and the live album At Folsom Prison . Marley  is about two and a half hours long but
Bob Marley's life and music and impact is so rich you almost wish it were a six hour TV miniseriesinstead. Fela Kuti was the Bob Marley of Africa and this useful two-fer is a good introduction to thosewho saw the Broadway show or have heard some of his magnetic music and want to know more. Teacher
Don't Teach Me No Nonsense  is an hour long documentary at its best when Kuti is talking or singing. the
nearly 90 minute concert film from 1978 shows Kuti in fine teacher form, taking ten minutes for a
glorifying introduction, a lecture on who he is and what he's going to do before actually getting down to
sing. The sound quality isn't great but Kuti surely is. Finally, if you've read this far you're a true music fan
so you're sure to enjoy John Cusack's High Fidelity , a fine translation of the novel to America and a love
letter to music with some classic scenes in the record store that make it essential. Sadly, Cusack has hit awall in the last decade and hasn't really done anything of more than modest interest. Maybe he should

STRIKE BACK SEASON ONE  ($59.96 BluRay combo; HBO/Cinemax)</p>
<p>THE ROOKIES SECOND SEASON  ($44.99 DVD; Shout) -- Misfits  is a UK show about teens who
suddenly develop supernatural powers and use them to protect their home town. Buffy For Brits?
Chronicle The TV Series? Take your pick. It was initially seen here only on Hulu, which let this witty ifmodest show feel just right -- finding it on Hulu made it unique and surely Hulu is where a lot of its core
audience lives. (Watching TV shows live is so  2008.) Some of those kids love Dr. Who  so Matt Smith
might lure them to this sports films about an unlikely duo competing in the 1948 Games. Going For Gold
fine for those with an Olympics hangover, love Chariots of Fire  or simply crush on Smith. Grimm  is a
show I watched for a few episodes and then moved on. TV has so much to offer it's hard to commit to a
new show that doesn't wow you. but friends who love this sort of programming insist it found its footing
about halfway through the season so if the mythology isn't too complicated, I'll catch up. Garrow's Law
isn't nearly as interesting as the historical figure William Garrow that it's based on. But this legal period
thriller is fine fare for those crazy about the genre. Strike Back  is really season two, but it's the first one
seen in the US (on Cinemax). A more action-oriented, more humorous spin on 24  and the frenetic UK
show Spooks , it's good mindless fun the British accent makes you pretend it's more sophisticated than it
actually is. Plus, I love their new tagline: Diplomacy Is Overrated. (And Season One was a stand-alone
storyline so you won't be lost at all.) Finally, The Rookies  was a typical Aaron Spelling offering with a
patina of social concern by humanizing the LA police force. It's mostly fun just to see Kate Jackson of
Charlie's Angels  and Michael Ontkean of Twin Peaks  in this early commercial success.</p>

RIO GRANDE  ($29.95 BluRay; Olive)
LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY  ($24.95 DVD; Kino) -- Some acclaimed movies to wind up the column.
La Grande Illusion often makes short lists of the greatest films of all time. But it drops out of the Top 50
in the latest Sight & Sound poll. Did they make a mistake? You judge via this fine looking print. DerekJarman sees two early films get a BluRay release -- Sebastiane is a spin on Billy Budd that mythologizes aChristian saint and gay icon. The Tempest is Shakespeare on a dime with a musical finale Busby Berkeleywould be proud of featuring "Stormy Weather," natch. Many aficionados consider Johnny Guitar one ofdirector Nicholas Ray's greatest. I think they're out of their mind and the only real pleasure to derivefrom it is its campy goofiness. Joan Crawford agrees with me and who'd disagree with her (at least to herface)? Rio Grande is the soft landing for John Ford's Cavalry trilogy, whose first two films are classics.Still it has John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara in a dry run for The Quiet Man. Finally, Little Lord
Fauntleroy is a predictable programmer despite its high-toned pedigree but it's clear even 76 years later
why Freddie Bartholomew and Mickey Rooney were such huge child stars.

Every Seuss movie sucks. He and Bill Watterson (of Calvin & Hobbes fame) were struck from the
same mold: no product line, no crappy merch based on wonderful characters who lived on the page,and that was enough. 
Ted G. wasn't cold in his grave yet when his wife and family inked deals to market the heck out of
every Seuss property, plus terrible cutting-room floor stuff such as "Daisy-head Maisy." It's allgarbage.Go back to the books; that's all any child needs for wonder, imagination and creativity.

You're aware that the target audience for Dr. Seuss movies is children whose ages are still in the
single digits, right?
Also, it's technically Season 2 of Strike Back,  for there was a six-part first season released only in
the UK: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Chris-Ryans-Strike-Back-DVD/dp/B0039WHKE0
11:48 AM on 08/11/2012
HI Blackjac, I can't change the packaging on the DVDs or what the studio calls it but I did
indeed make that very point in my review of Strike Back. Thanks for the info and link
anyway. However, as for the audience of Dr Seuss being little children, there are excellent
movies and TV shows and books geared towards little kids and there are pieces of junk for
little kids. Some might satisfy kids but bore adults, some might satisfy adults but be toosophisticated for kids and the best ones of all either have an enduring simplicity andartfulness (like say the TV special Cat in the Hat or Winnie the Pooh) while others resonate
differently at different stages of your life (like the novel Peter Pan). But just because a kid
is 7 years old doesn't mean you have to settle for them watching junk.
07:22 AM on 08/12/2012
Like a 7-year-old's going to know the difference anyway.  They just want to laugh
and have fun.

The reason these movie adaptations are so awful is because they are trying to extend books thatcan be read in as little as 10 minutes into two hour movies. As a result, unnecessary subplots andcharacters have to be added to fill out the movies. I thought "The Cat In The Hat" was especially
unfunny.
02:23 PM on 08/08/2012
The best movie made from a Seuss book is the cartoon version of "How The Grinch Stole
Christmas". No Seuss movie should have ANY words added to those from the book, and NO Seussmovie should star real people dressed up.
The movie adaptation of Maurice Sendak's "Where The Wild Things Are" also did a great disservice
to a beloved writer's vision.
04:22 PM on 08/08/2012
The original made-for-TV version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas is still shown everyyear, for good reason. The music is fantastic, and holds up better than some of the oldDisney stuff.Permalink  | Share it

Totally agree!
07:24 PM on 08/08/2012
But the live-action Jim Carrey one restored Seuss' original intent to denounce the
commercialism of Christmas: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_4LmbuSmpI   It gave the
Grinch actual motive beyond simply being a jerk.
03:07 AM on 08/09/2012
That was the whole point of the book and the cartoon that reproduced the bookexactly--with great music. The live action was awful, and Cindi Lou Who was WAYmore than two.

That Grinch movie with Jim Carrey? That is the Stuff of Nightmares. Just ghastly, major FAIL.
Marilyn Monroe's movies have been shown this month, and it seems they (and she) are criticism
from some wet-behind-the-ears people who just don't see it. They focus on her voluptuous figure
and pointy bras! The movies are all we have, of course they are kind of dated, and she didn't haveany attractive compatible male stars to be romantic with (Tom Ewell?? Joseph Cotton?? Ew.). Butthere was only one Marilyn Monroe, and she will forever be THE icon. Who else could be on herlevel? Angelina Jolie, that weird bag of rattling bones?
07:49 AM on 08/08/2012
WE loved the Lorax. And all Dr. Seus movies. must be a man writing this.
11:53 AM on 08/11/2012
Huh? What does being a man have to do with anything? If you liked ALL feature filmadaptations of Dr Seuss you must be an uber fan -- even the estate didn't love all themovies, despite the money they've pulled in. But I appreciate good children's programming
and even better children's programming that transcends the needs of kids and prove an
enduring work of art. Certain shows on the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon might not beshows I'll watch regularly but I can appreciate them as appropriate for kids and much betterthan low bar fare that peddles cereal and is just stuffed with dumb action and humor.Naturally, the best stuff can appeal to kids and adults...even if one of the adults is a male.Do you really think only women can appreciate and understand movies and TV shows and
books made for kids and which ones work?llisa

I liked The Lorax and Horton Hears a Who was awesome. The only ones that sucked were the Jim
Carrey Grinch and Mike Myers Cat in the Hat.
04:46 AM on 08/08/2012
As someone who grew up on Dr. Seuss, I have to agree with the assessment that, apart from theoriginal Chuck Jones rendition of "The Grinch that Stole Christmas" and the sometimes unfocusedbut basically intact "Cat in the Hat" (short cartoon version), adaptations of Seuss have been inferiorto the point of insulting. But then again, the movies were evidently done by individuals who wantedto cash in on the popularity of the good 'Doctor' without trying to understand, let alone capture, hiselfin sense of humor.
