THEATER: LESS IS MORE AT "MRS. MURRAY'S
MENAGERIE"
MRS.  MURRAY'S  MENAGERIE  *** 1/2 out of ****
ARS  NOVA  
I love the epic. The  Inheritance  just won the Olivier for Best Play and I
can't wait for that six hour AIDS drama to come to New York. I admire
the manic. A stream of new shows are as influenced by In  Living  Color
and Monty Python as Oscar Wilde, with Ain't  No  Mo'  at the Public the
latest, thrilling example. But let's hear it for restraint, for not goingoverboard, for stopping far short of the kitchen sink and being all the
more powerful for it.
That's my reaction to the subtle, funny, absorbing and spot-on new
play Mrs.  Murray's  Menagerie.  Directed and acted to quiet perfection,
it's a pitch perfect execution of a simple idea. The setting is the 1970s
and we watch as six varied adults take part in a focus group. They're all
parents and all fans of the children's TV show  Mrs.  Murray's
Menagerie.  That beloved series combines live actors with puppets a la
Mr.  Roger's  Neighborhood  and after a long run, it's coming to an end.
The adults sit around a table and are led in a discussion of the showthey love and two potential spin-offs. Mrs. Murray is played by a blackwoman and the focus group is notably diverse, featuring three menand three women that amount to a nifty microcosm of society. Race,
needless to say, rears its head. So does gender and class and child
rearing and a dozen other ideas, all of them embedded in the story sosimply and naturally you never really feel they're being raised  at all.
They're just...there, as in life.
Created by The Mad Ones and the ensemble with Ars Nova, the show
is directed by Lila Neugebauer so invisibly that you half believe theaudience is sitting behind a one-way mirror   and watching an actual
focus group. Without histrionics, without a big explosion, without
tossed-back chairs or collapsing walls, Mrs.  Murray's  MenagerieMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

Like a play set in a jury or hospital waiting room or stalled elevator,throwing a disparate group of people together to see what happens is a
time-proven dramatic device. Nonetheless, watching these particular
people debate the finer points of a kid's show and the behavior ofvarious puppets is fascinating. We come to know them without anyonerevealing much of anything about themselves.
Typically, I'd go down the cast list and describe the actors and
characters. While it seems silly to discuss spoilers in a show where
very little happens, much of the pleasure comes from discovering whothese people are and making up your own mind about them, ratherthan me tipping you off that this person is kind of a jerk or that person
has low self-esteem. (Mind you, I do have very strong opinions now on
Mrs.  Murray's  Menagerie.  Why the heck isn't the spin-off being built
around the human librarian everyone loves?)  
Just trust me that this is an ensemble in every sense of the word and
each actor is doing exceptional work. Director Neugebauer works with
them and a terrific creative team to create one of the most finely tunedproductions I've seen in ages. My guest referenced Clybourne  Parkand I thought of the Bobby Steggert drama Boy  -- not because they
have so much in common, but simply because they are all shows that
succeeded so well on every level.
Of course, we're trained to expect High Drama. Even though I admired
the restraint, I instinctively wondered if -- as good as it is -- the plotmight have pushed itself just a little  bit further, increased the
confrontation that little bit more? No, they hit it right. A hand on aknee creates an uncomfortable moment...but not the #MeToo callingout you want, which you know almost never happens. Answers toquestions from the moderator become passive aggressive taunts, butother than a sidelong glance, no one says anything. At the end, the
adults go   their own way and each goodbye feels weighted with►  June (3)

<p>meaning. One departure is hilarious, another just as jerk-ish as you'd
expect, and a few are heartfelt -- the goodbyes of people who sort ofmade a connection but know they'll never see each other again. Justlike life.
This is miles away in tone from Underground  Railroad  Game,  the Ars
Nova hit which returns to NYC for about two weeks from May 30-
June 15.  But just like that success, this will surely be remembered as
one of the best plays of the year.
