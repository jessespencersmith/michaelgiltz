By MICHAEI GILTZ
cToRS who make slapstick
comedies don't walk around
getting pies thrown in their
faces. And actors who appear in
musicals aren't forced to br€ak into
song at their local Starbucks.
So why does it seem like child
actors who appear in horror films
get cursed career-wise (and some-
times otherwise)?
Now we're sure
Seamus Davey-Fitz-
patrick - who plays
Damien, the spawn
of Satan in the new
version of "The
omen" - will be
just fine. Even if the
studio has tempted
fate by opening the
remake (also star-
ring Liev Schreiber
and Julia Stiles) on
June 6 - that's
right,6/6/06.
But'here are the
fates of other child
actors who danced
with the devil in the
pale moonlight. Mr.
and Mrs, Davey-Fitzpatrick, please
take care with young Seamus.
'THE OMEN',(1976)
Harvey Stephens, who played
Damien, was so scarily convincing
that apparently even casting direc-
tors were afraid to meet him. Aside
from one TV credit. he never acted
again. Or WAS he acting?
'THE SH|N|NG'(1980)
Danny Lloyd, the 6-year-old kid
who creeped us out with "Redrum,'
made only one other movie. Now the
greatest horror of all: He's trapped in
a room filled with screaming kids.
That's right - he's a teacher.
'POLTERGETST'(1982)
Blonde cutie Heather O'Rourke
turned "They're here!" into a catch
phrase. But persistent illness - and
perhaps a misdiagnosis - plagued
her young life and she died at age 12
while filming "Poltergeist lll."
'THE STXTH SENSE" (rg!t!t)
Haley Joel Osment shot to fame
playing a little boy who sees dead
people. But. ever since then he's
clearly been possessed by the spirit
of a 63-year-old man. What else can
explain his unnerving maturity?</p>
