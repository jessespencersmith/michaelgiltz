9/01/2004 09:55:00 AMChechnyen people yearn to break free from Russia and establish theirown nation. Fine. They claim Russia's military control over theircountry is a holdover from the days of the Soviet Union. Fine. I don'tclaim to know the tortured history of it all and I'm certainly no big fanof strongman Putin and his autocratic hold on power in the devolvingRussia.But in this day and age of international media -- where even you andI are familiar with Chechnya and at least their basic goal -- there isABSOLUTELY no justification for grabbing control of a school andholding hundreds of children and teachers hostage.This is completely and utterly immoral and cannot be defended onany grounds for any reason for any cause. I don't necessarilyapprove, but attack cops, attack government buildings, attackmilitary installations -- but never target innocent civilians. It's wrongin Russia, it's wrong in New York City and -- yes -- it's wrong inIsrael. Why is it so hard for people to completely and utterly rejectsuch vile tactics and to demand that any group -- howeversympathetic you may be to their cause -- END THEM COMPLETELY orlose your entire support? Why do you condemn Al Qaeda, condemnChenyen terrorists but defend Hamas and the PLO? NOTHING justifiesthese actions. Nothing justifies the vile Iraqi Islamic militants whohave seized workers and threatened to slaughter them unless Franceends its ban on scarves, for goodness sake. Nothing justifies flyingplanes into buildings. Nothing justifies seizing a school and holdinglittle children hostage. And NOTHING justifies putting someone on abus or in a cafe in Israel with explosives strapped to their chest andblowing them up. Whenever you refuse to condemn one of theseacts, you encourage them all.
