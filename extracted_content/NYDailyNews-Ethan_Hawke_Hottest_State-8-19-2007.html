ti)Though talking aboul "Hottest Srate,',
the movie he adapted based on his oM
1997 debut qovel, is the purpose for do-
ing press, the first words out of Hawke,s
mouth echo the classic complaint of New
Yorkers upset at their changing ciry
"You know that great diner where we
talked before?" asks Hawke, talking about
the Chelsea spot he was giving intetriews
at Iast fall for his Tony-nominated work in
the epic trilogy "The Coast oI Utopia " "It,s
gone! I lyent away and came back, and it
was gone "
Hawl(e's new morie celebl ates tlie city
through 1he story of a stnrgghng- bu1 confi-
detli vr>rtrrg aclrit, !,'ill1ililt iNlail{ \\'eill)el),i falling hard for Sara, an aspiring down-
i town singer (Catalina Sandino Moreno)
The film acknowledges the sad truth that a
frrst crush isn't nearly as memorable as a
first heartbreak And like many, Hawke,s
heaft can be broken when the city he has
Iived in since he was 10 changes too much,
too fast
, "I couldn't believe it when Tower Re-
cords uptown closed," says Hawke, nomi-
nated for an Academy Award for Best Sup-
pofting Actol for 2001's "Training Day"
and original scr eenplay for 200.1's "Before
Sunset" (wilh.lulie Delpy and Richard l-in-
kialel') Born in Austur and raiseci part-
l\'1it Ne!\ Jt,t,reV, hrt hits rl!c ?tfirer'1i()n f.)jthan Hawke has a small role as an absent dad in his second
film as a director and screenwdter, ',The Flottest State,,,
opening Friday. And while the 36-year-old Hawke says the
most important role in his life is being a good father to his
own two children, and he's known as an Oscar-nominat-
ed actor and writer, a filmmaker and a regular on the stage,
perhaps the part he plays best is impassioned Newyorker.New York that only those who finally iound
themselves here in the city feel "I couldn,t
believe it."
That's one less place to feature the
soundtrack to Ns film, an imovative work
filled with new songs by singer-song5vrit-
er Jesse Harris (who's worked with Ndrah
Jones, among others) but perfomed by ev-
eryone tiom Wllie Nelson to Feist
As Hawke walks through Union Square
toward a photo shoot, he casually responds
to the one or two people who speak up
when he walks by, though riost people rec-
ognize him but leave him alone, in classic
New York fashion With his straggly hair
and downtown energy, Hawke fits right in
with the hippie, bohemian vibe that strug-
gles to remain alive in the neighborhood
alongside Whole Foods and Starbucks
And the Chelsea Hotel? It's no suttrrise

llawke looks to be sturdier,
having long ago made the transition from
child zrctor in "Explorers" (1985) and "Dead
Pr:eis Society" (1989, his breakthrough) to
an accornplished actor on stage ("Henry lV"
-with Kelin Kline) to movies ranging from
the generationally hip ("Reality Bites") and
the shaggily romantic ("Before Sunrise")
ro modem updates ("Great Expectations,"
"Hamlet") and genre flicks ('Ga$::.a," 
/"Taking Lives," "Assault on Precinct
1 3") Upcoming projects include
Sidney Lurrret's "Before the Dev-
i.l Knows You're Dead," co-star-
ring Philip Seymour Hoffman
and due in October, and "Day-
breakers," a vampire tlick that
seemed the most dramatic switch
he could possibly make after Tom
Stoppard's three-part Russian epic
"Utopia" at Lincoln Center:
Alwavs passionate and opinionated.
Hawke is definrtely less fierl and pointed
than he s'as as a -vounger malr as he him-
sell would be the first to say. So, when adapt-
ing a book he rvrrjte more thalt a decade ago,

"l was so idealistic about love and art and
politics," says Hawke "I was so idealistic I
still am, but the world is much grayer than I
thought it was lt's harder to make your way
than I thouBht
"i'm 36, and sharing custody of kids is
really . . you know, you have to work
\ really hard at what I would call
love in action' - really being
Io\ing, sharing, being forgiv-
ing, apologizing, you know?
It'sbigstuff Iflhadgone
throughthatwhen Iwas 17,
I would never have been able
to do it It takes all I can [mus-
ter] now
"It's really hard," says Hawke,
whose own pal ents married young wnosu own pal ents marfled young
ancl separated when he was 5 "Everybody
can have the best intentions. and it's still
hard lt aiu t easy at all l'm much more for -
€iivinB ot thai charactet the absent dad, than
I rvas While nry r elationship to my father
does not mirror the one in the movie, it emo-
tionaih rnirrors it There are some similar i-ties, though it's not as simplistic as that lt's
much more complicated.
"The biggest difference between me now
and ne at, say, 2I is my relationship with
my father. He eould relate to me orrce I was
grown We found each other in a way that we
couldn't when I was younger And he's been
a real asset. I've been amued how ntuch
easier life is when you go through life with a
positive relationship with your father. I didn't
know what a weight that was "
Professionally, Hawke feels good about
where he's at and isn't too wonied about
what the reception for "The Hottest State"
could be He'd love to be asked to dil ect
sometiing else, but since his labor of love,
"Chelsea Walls" - which co-starred Rosario
Dawson. Vincent D'Onofrio. Natasha Rich-
ardson and Kris Kristofferson - disappeared
so completely, he says he only hopes "Hottest
State" will "pierce the radar".iust enough
"l have a secret hope that sometime over
the next l0 years thai there will be some guy
of girl going through a terrible breakup," he
says, ever the romantic, "and their friends
will slip thenr the D\rD and it'Il mean some-
tlrins to thenl " a</p>
