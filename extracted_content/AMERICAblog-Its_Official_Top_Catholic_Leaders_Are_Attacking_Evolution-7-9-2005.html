7/09/2005 05:00:00 AMGood lord, the sky really is falling for American Catholics whohave to deal with officials that protect child molesters, belittleand marginalize the victims, demand that government officialselected to represent all citizens deny basic rights to those itdeems unfit and on and on. The latest (pointed to us bythreader An Other Greek)? The NYT confirms that the Op-Edwe linked to yesterday attacking science and reason was nofluke or misunderstanding: the cardinal who penned it spoke toCardinal Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict) and got the go-aheadto "correct" the decades-long stance of the Church which wasto stay out of science since it had made a fool of itself in thatarea for so long that it undercut the Church's authority onmoral issues.Not only was the article a direct assault on evolution, it wasdone in cooperation with the very group that wants to shove itsown religious beliefs of Creationism aka Intelligent Design intothe public schools, the very fundamentalist Christians who hateCatholics. I keep saying fundamentalist Christians hateCatholicism and it's been true for ages, but the Catholics incharge seem to be their cup of tea.This sort of cooperation is going to have serious repercussionsin the public sphere down the road, assuming you don't alreadythink the politicking that cost Kerry the Catholic vote hasn'talready dramatically affected this country. The fights in publicschools to teach science in science class just got a lot fiercer.Cardinal Schönborn, who is on the Vatican's Congregationfor Catholic Education, said the office had no plans to issuenew guidance to teachers in Catholic schools on evolution.But he said he believed students in Catholic schools, and allschools, should be taught that evolution is just one of manytheories. Many Catholic schools teach Darwinian evolution,in which accidental mutation and natural selection of thefittest organisms drive the history of life, as part of theirscience curriculum.Darwinian evolution is the foundation of modern biology.While researchers may debate details of how themechanism of evolution plays out, there is no crediblescientific challenge to the underlying theory.
