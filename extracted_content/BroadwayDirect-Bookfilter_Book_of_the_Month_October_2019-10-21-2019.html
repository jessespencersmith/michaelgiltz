Jerome Robbins: By Himself
Edited and with commentary by Amanda Vail$40, KnopfPublished October 1
Here’s a little secret: Magisterial biographies and engrossing feature stories about an artist are
wonderful, but if you’re a fan of that artist, it’s a special thrill to dive into the research that waspulled together to create that biography or article. Sure, it’s fun to read about A.A. Milne.; doesthat compare to seeing the real Winnie the Pooh doll or reading Milne’s handwritten drafts of astory or poem? Not even close.
Choreographer and director Jerome Robbins is a signal figure in musical theater and dance. On
the Town, The King and I, West Side Story, and Fiddler on the Roof  are just the tip of the
iceberg. That’s why he’s been celebrated in books and TV specials for years. If you’re a fan,maybe you read Amanda Vail’s acclaimed 2006 biography, Somewhere.
More than a decade later, Vail has delivered a new gift for musical-theater buffs, pulling from a
wide array of primary sources and offering them up in a new book. Letters, journal entries,sketches, photographs, and an unfinished memoir all contribute to this kaleidoscopic portrait ofRobbins — and all of it delivered by Robbins himself.
Jerome Robbins, by Himself
BOOKFILTER’S OCTOBER BOOK OF THE MONTH
MICHAEL GILTZ  | OCTOBER 21, 2019
SHARE</p>
<p>Vail offers commentary and context as Robbins’s own voice details the work he did in
revolutionizing American ballet, confesses his shame over naming names to the House Un-
American Activities Committee during the McCarthy era, and brings to life his friendships bothpersonal and professional, from the likes of Robert Graves to Stephen Sondheim.
It’s personal, revealing, and just plain fun, especially for those already familiar with Robbins and
his career. Consider this a deep dive for those who want more, or for anyone with a taste for agrab-bag of musical-theater nuggets.
