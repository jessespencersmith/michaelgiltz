From the Publisher: A capstone to an unforgettable career  Over the past
half century, the great shape-shifting poet C. K. Williams took upon
himself the poet's task: to record with candor and ardor âthe burden ofbeing alive.â In Falling Ill , his final volume of poems, he brings this task to
its conclusion, bearing witness to a restless mind's encounter with thebrute fact of the body's decay, the spirit's erasure. Written with unsparinglyricism and relentless discursive logic, these brave poems faceunflinchingly -- the dreadful edge of a precipice -- where a futureless
future stares back. Urgent, unpunctuated, headlong, vertiginous, they race

What We Say
The much lauded poet C.K. Williams (the Pulitzer, National Book Awards, you name it) was diagnosed with a cancer of

her panic) to death itself, to whom he mutters and questions and confronts. It's philosophical and wry and rages with a
beautiful, restrained passion that is all the more moving for being so seemingly controlled. "Focus" is the word that springs
to mind again and again when reading this collection and surely a diagnosis of terminal cancer might provide at least that.Cancer is not a gift but Williams has delivered one by looking it squarely in the eye. -- Michael Giltz
