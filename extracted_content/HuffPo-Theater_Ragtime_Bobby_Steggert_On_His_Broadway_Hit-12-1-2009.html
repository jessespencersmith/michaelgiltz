Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyExclusive: "Ragtime's" Bobby
Steggert On His Broadway Hit

Actor Bobby Steggert was fated to star in a revival of
Ragtime , though "fate" might not be putting it strongly
enough.
As a kid growing up in Maryland (high school valedictorian, by the way), Steggert was already doing
professional theater. His first paying job? The Madison Square Garden spectacle A Christmas Carol, with
music by Alan Menken and lyrics by Lynn Ahrens (whose next show would be the 1997-98 Tony winner
Ragtime ).
"I still have the beautiful handwritten note she gave to everyone  in that show and that was some 15 years
ago," says the 28 year old Steggert.
The summer before he moved to New York to study at NYU, Steggert had some assigned reading,
including E.L. Doctorow's novel Ragtime . During orientation week, before classes even began, Steggert
went to a Broadway show: Ragtime , featuring Audra McDonald in her Tony-winning performance. After

<p>serving as an understudy on Master Harold and The Boys, the director of that show encouraged Steggert
to try out for his revival of 110 In The Shade  starring...Audra McDonald.
"It's because of Lonny Price," says Steggert, who at one point foolishly thought plays were more seriousand important than musicals but has made his name in the latter. "He had no idea that I'd ever sung. Istudied musicals and certainly did them in high school. I'm certainly not a pop singer or a rock singer. Ijust loved the play The Rainmaker  so much and I loved Audra as a performer so much so I thought I'd
just go in. I guess my take on the character was what they were looking for. They said, 'Do you dance?' Isaid, 'Not so much.'"
Doesn't Steggert know that if a casting director asks if you can juggle or ride a horse or play the guitar
you're supposed to say --
"I know, you're supposed to say yes. I'm learning," he laughs. "I was the only person who danced in that
show so that was quite ironic. I could show up every day and just have a really good time. I don't think Irealized the luck of that, getting to shine in a great part and have a really great actress playing my sister."
Steggert savors his luck now. After a string of critically acclaimed performances (including 110 In The
Shade, which ran less than three months), he's in an honest-to-goodness hit with Ragtime . The
panoramic tale of turn of the century America, it encompasses the lives of a privileged white family (withSteggert as the combustible Younger Brother), a hardworking and talented black couple and Jewish
immigrants hoping to make their fortune or at least survive.
The box office isn't explosive yet, but with reviews like it received, the show is certain to be a front runner
for Tony's Best Revival. Ben Brantley of the New York Times  finds the revival superior to the original,
adding, "Mr. Steggert, as a tentative rebel in search of a cause, provides a hot center of real pain." TheNew York Daily News gave it four out of five stars , saying "it's hard to argue with a revival as surefooted
as Marcia Milgrom Dodge's strikingly staged and vividly performed redo." It also singles out Steggert as
"terrific." Variety raves, saying, "this is big-brain, bold-strokes musical-theater storytelling at its most
vibrant" and -- again -- notes Steggert's compelling intensity. Even the irascible John Simon of
Bloomberg  said it was "good to have Ragtime  back on Broadway" and praised Steggert first among the
cast.
But don't imagine that just winning charm is what won the critics over. Steggert may have the boyish
handsomeness of a leading man but he's been consistently drawn to quirky, dark characters. Younger
Brother is no different: unhappy living with his sister and her family, miserable at his job in a fireworks
factory, he burns with passionate intensity that needs a focus. First it lights on gossip page tootsie EvelynNesbit, then the radical activist Emma Goldman and finally Colehouse Walker, the avenging angel
demanding justice for the death of his fiance and the destruction of his car by bigots.
Steggert's biggest laugh comes when he simply blurts out to Walker that he knows how to blow things up.
But that's exactly what he's good at, as shown even more explicitly in Doctorow's book, where Younger
Brother's role as a terrorist and inventor of weapons of war is spelled out more clearly. Steggert bringsthat dark heart into his performance.
"The book is dark and satirical and sexual," says Steggert, who spoke with me by phone just before the
show opened. "The musical is more sincere and more emotional but they're both equally fascinating andrich. There's not a better gift than getting to play people unlike yourself because you get to explore parts
of yourself you rarely express. I think that's healthy and also very exciting as a performer. I just had to
find my own anger and find my own sense of injustice in the world we live in today and there are somany examples of inequality and injustice."
Though Steggert had charm to spare in 110 In The Shade,  his Off Broadway work showed Steggert's
predilection for the offbeat. In the brilliantly designed and genuinely odd show The Slug Bearers Of
Kayrol Island,  Steggert played a man obsessed with instruction manuals to old and outdated appliances.
(His best musical number involved reading those directions set to witty melodies.)

In Yank!,  a very promising musical, Steggert had the lead role of a gay soldier who falls in love with a
buddy during World War II but is rather passive and does some questionable things to survive (though
he's so appealing in the role, you almost don't realize it until afterwards).
If there's any downside to Ragtime  coming along now, it was the difficult choice of choosing between it
and Yank !, which plans to open Off Broadway in February 2010  after several workshop and other
incarnations.
"It broke my heart because it's a project I care so much for," says Steggert, "and I've been in love with it
for two years now. I'm incredibly close with the writers and the director and the choreographer and it's a
role that means so much to me. It was a really bittersweet decision. I'm so happy Ragtime  is resonating
with audiences. It feels like it was a good decision. But leaving Yank!  behind was really, really difficult. I
know the show will succeed."
Now of course Steggert is focused completely on Ragtime .
"I am committed for a year," says Steggert. "It's been very relieving as I own an apartment and have amortgage to pay. It's also very frankly intimidating because the show takes a great deal out of all of usvocally and emotionally and physically. I'm very committed to the story, to telling it fully and properly. I
know it's going to be a very exciting year and it's also going to be a very exhausting one.
"I've been learning it's not even a good idea to really even speak on days off. I have much less social
energy and certainly less ability to focus on other parts of my life and I'm hoping for a balance to come in
the next few months. But it's what is most important to me and what I'm dedicated to and I'm willing tosacrifice those other things."
So for now Steggert will cheer on Yank!  from the sidelines instead of center stage. And he tries to come
down from the sad and angry place that performing Ragtime  takes him by riding the subway home and
listening to jazz like Dinah Washington on his iPod. And home will be quiet too because Steggert is "very
single. I'm certainly open to the possibility but there's too much on my plate right now. Not this week?
Not this year."
