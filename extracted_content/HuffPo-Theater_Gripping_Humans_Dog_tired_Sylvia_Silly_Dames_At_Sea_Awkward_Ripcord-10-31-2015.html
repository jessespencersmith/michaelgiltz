I have a friend - a smart, savvy theater-goer - who didn'tbuy tickets for it because the mere description of The Humans bored him. And no wonder: a family gathering(Thanksgiving, in this case), petty grievances, old grudges brought forth, revelations of a personal nature (jobsand hearts lost or won) and so on. Sigh. The difference? Somehow Karam's play brings these terribly familiarevents to specific and engrossing life.It helps that he's been given a flawless production by director Joe Mantello and an excellent cast. I for one thinkSons Of The Prophet is a better play. But with three shows under his belt - The Humans, Sons Of The Prophetand Speech & Debate - what a great situation to be in. We're not arguing about which play is good; we'rearguing about which play is better. If The Humans strives for a zeitgeist-y aura of significance it doesn't quiteearn, at least it comes very close. I can imagine a lesser production down the road revealing some of thosemodest weakenesses...and it's good enough now to know those productions will surely be coming.Brigid (Sarah Steele) and her boyfriend Richard (Arian Moayed) have just moved into their ground floorChinatown apartment, very much a starter place with its noisy neighbors, cigarette-filled alley and diceyelectricity. Nonetheless, Brigid's family has trouped into the city for Thanksgiving: mom (Jayne Houdyshell,tremendously good), dad (Reed Birney, ditto), Aimee nursing a heartache over breaking up with her girlfriend(Cassie Beck) and the grandmother Momo who has spiraled away into dementia (Lauren Klein).The jokes they make, the stories they tell, even the revelations they offer are not amped up or shocking in anyway: they are, perhaps, shocking only in their mundane nature. But for 95 minutes that feels much longer thanthat (in a good way), the interplay of these characters is tense, funny, and absorbing. The mini-alliances, thesparks of humor between siblings or the big sister playfully making the new boyfriend feel part of the family, thefather and young man uneasily sharing a moment as they politely make nice is all riveting.Karam's dialogue is somehow fresh and specific and the cast makes the most of it. Praise them all but theparents stick in your mind. Birney is marvelous as the father burdened with financial woes and the need to sharebad news with his daughters without wanting them to feel burdened or - worse - think less of him as a providerand father and husband. But Houdyshell is just sensational as well, taking in a cutting comment from onedaughter with aggrieved silence, offering an opinion to another even when she knows it will be looked downupon dismissively as only a child can look down on their parent. (What do you do when you've succeeded byraising kids who are smarter than you and won't let you forget it even if they could?) The love is never</p>

https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=2dbf80ae-3342-4314-8961-fd07756d2cfd&ses=4&sh=2&sds=5&2/7questioned but The Humans makes clear no one can wound you quite like family.And none of this captures the eerie vibe Karam is striving for and sometimes succeeds at. The play begins insilence with Birney suspended in silence in this strange, gray, rundown apartment. The lights come onominously and for a moment one thinks of a horror film. That's no accident. Birney's dad is plagued by baddreams and so is Richard. Financial woes press down on most all of them, with dreams shattered or delayedalmost across the board. Richard actually comes from wealth and will receive a trust fund inheritance when he's40, a detail that irks the dad. Thunderous noises keep coming from the upstairs neighbor, at first just annoyingbut ultimately sounding more like the Four Horsemen Of The Apocalypse. Future productions will undoubtedlyhave this grim cubicle of an apartment disintegrating before our eyes once the distressing climax is reached.That's all part of the Significance that is so loudly announced by the end. It's a small fly in the ointment for ashow that is fundamentally strong and making a welcome transfer to Broadway where a playwright of Karam'stalents clearly belongs. Mantello does him right with this pitch-perfect world premiere and kudos all around to thetechnical team he oversaw so well (David Zinn's depressingly believable set, Sarah Laux's spot-on costumes,Justin Townsend's purposefully fickle lighting and Fitz Patton's essential sound design). They give Karam'svision the portent of doom his play called for without overburdening it too much. It's a very good play for the99%, even if it's not 100% perfect.SYLVIA ** out of **** CORT THEATREIt's not a dog. And dog lovers will surely enjoy the anthropomorphic romping of Annaleigh Ashford as the titularcanine. But the return of the comedy Sylvia seems to confirm it's an excellent showcase for a young actress buta poor showcase for playwright A.R. Gurney.Greg (Matthew Broderick) is a middle-aged man at a crossroads in life. His kids have gone off to college, he andhis wife have moved into Manhattan and his job in finance seems increasingly unfulfilling if not downrightpointless. Enter Sylvia (Ashford), a dog on the loose with a collar announcing her name but no way to find anowner. Greg is smitten - he needs something to love, after all - and takes Sylvia home, much to the dismay ofhis wife Kate (Julie White). Sylvia bounds all over the furniture, talks to everyone, sniffs everything and generallymakes herself at home as Kate very unhappily agrees to a trial period of just a few days. Ha!Kate is launching a new career, bringing Shakespeare to the "urban" kids (i.e. poor black and brown kids, oneassumes). Greg meanwhile is fighting repeatedly with his boss, refuses to take assignments and keeps takingoff more and more time to wander Central Park and even the city at all hours of the day and night. Desperate,Kate snags a prestigious grant (aren't all grants prestigious?) to head to London for six months and wants themto go together. Dogs are quarantined for precisely six months before being allowed to come into the UK so Gregmust choose: Sylvia or his wife? It won't be an easy decision.The show is almost too frivolous to describe. The work tensions, the strain on their marriage and so forth imply aweightiness that Sylvia simply doesn't reach for and certainly doesn't attain. About the only pleasure to begarnered here is the silly interactions between Ashford and the rest of the cast. She has fun freaking out andcursing up a storm when spotting a cat. And the show's high point is certainly the slapstick scene where Sylviakeeps sniffing the crotch of Kate's friend Phyllis (played amusingly by Robert Sella - in one of three good roles --sporting a sensationally funny wig by Campbell Young Associates).But that scene has a broad farce nature completely out of sorts with the rest of the show. Broderick, an actor Ilove who has been distressingly stuck on a low simmer for years now, perks up a bit in a part that might havebeen written for him. But he's still very low-key, with the usually ebullient Julie White even tamer in a role thatoffers little for her to dig into. They barely seem to exist together, much less seem married. Indeed, all fouractors appear to be acting in different shows. (When Julie's friend shows up, the dialogue is so confusing, I</p>

The fact that it felt so different from everything that came before or sincedidn't help.)And none of the travails besetting this Manhattan couple make a moment's sense. We're led up to a big decisionand yet when it comes, we don't quite believe it when it comes because up until that second we have no reasonto believe it's the best choice for Greg or one that he'd make. Then in a head-spinning bit of confusion, severalthings happen. Sylvia lays the blame at Kate in a speech that makes absolutely no sense, Kate has a revelationor realization or something (one I didn't even grasp had happened at first since it too makes no sense) and thenwe're told in a pointless epilogue to ignore the last ten minutes of the show because that isn't what happenedafter all.What you get at the end is a little pile of doo-doo. Just pretend to ignore and step around that little mess of afinale on your way out. Of course little messes are one of the complications you accept when bringing a dog intoyour life (and Ashford certainly makes a cute one). They're fun and playful and then keep wanting to play longafter you've lost interest.DAMES AT SEA ** ½ out of **** HELEN HAYES THEATREI'm sure producers would prefer we not discuss ticket prices or Broadway versus Off Broadway - just review theshow, damnit. But context is everything. Some movies work better as TV shows. Some novels should betrilogies and some trilogies should have stayed short stories. Some shows belong Off Broadway. And somedeserve a big splashy Broadway debut.I'll bet the musical Dames At Sea deserves both of these things. Watch the new revival and you'll surelyunderstand how a rinky-dink production with two pianos and a lot of heart played Off Broadway for ages. You'llalso understand why the folks who loved it thought it could live up to a fuller production with some honest-to-goodness sets, a (smallish) orchestra and a game six member cast.The whole nutty story is a genial tribute (NOT send-up, not really) to those silly musicals of the 1930s where asmall-town girl arrives in the big city with dreams of making it on Broadway and by golly gets the guy and thespotlight all in one madcap whirl! In a twist that's wonderfully delicious, the original modest 50-minute productiondebuted in a coffeehouse in Greenwich Village in 1966. The original lead for that kid-who-becomes-a-star showdropped out and 18-year-old Bernadette Peters took over. A star was literally born!Now after productions all over the world, this harmless nonsense makes its Broadway debut. It would be a sure-fire thing Off Broadway if Off Broadway still made financial sense anymore (too often, it doesn't). Director andchoreographer Randy Skinner kept tap dancing uppermost when casting as he made sure one and all coulddance with aplomb. Success! The dancing is fun and energetic and satisfying.That leaves the singing and acting. As two sailors, Cary Tedder and Danny Garnder are amiable fellas. Tedderplays Dick, a sailor with a seachest brimming over with terrific tunes. Sure he's wowed when the big Broadwaystar Mona Kent (a very fun Lesli Margherita) showers him with attention. But Ruby (Eloise Kropp), the new girlwho went straight from the bus station into the chorus line of that promising new musical Dames At Sea is hisone and only and don't you doubt it. Tedder and Garnder (who plays Lucky, a sailor dating a chorus girl namedJoan) are not great in the vocals department but these guys have charm. John Bolton on the other hand is top-notch as both the determined director Hennessey and the easily swayed Captain who has a battleship thatwould make a swell home for their suddenly adrift show.The real stars are the supporting women. Margherita (what a name!) has fun with the opener but really goes totown with her diva-like take on Dick's original song "That Mister Man Of Mine." She stops the show with herhijinks and delivers her one-liners with aplomb. So does Mari Davi as the seen-it-all chorus girl Joan. Davi</p>

The sweet book and lyricsare by George Haimsohn and Robin Miller, with period-perfect music by Jim Wise.Unfortunately, that's the first act. It's downhill from there, if never less than amusing. One misfire earlier is"Singapore Sue." The show has been a knowing spoof all along and a vaguely Asian-themed number makessense for those insensitive times. Yet it's supposed to be a marvelous showcase for the big star Mona, one sheinsists get put into the musical. Yet it's really a song for a male performer; a quibble, but it throws one off.More to the point, the two supporting actresses are terrific and completely overshadow Eloise Kropp as Ruby.Her vocals in particular are notably weak. You spend her big numbers hoping she'll get through them, notthinking "a star is born!" It's hardly fair to say she's no Bernadette Peters, of course. Her dancing is good andshe's appealing if never the center of attention she should be. (You're always anticipating the other gals more.)The role demands a triple threat, not a double threat, especially with her appearing in virtually every song in thesecond act (often as the lead singer). We're forced to think less and less of Ruby's chances just as we should becheering her on. It's a Dames At Sea with no star to steer by.With five dollar sets and this same cast it would deserve to have a long and healthy run Off Broadway wheremodest prices could make audiences feel they were in on the fun, discovering a show rather than paying topdollar for what they expect to be a luxury cruise liner. On Broadway, I fear the feet-first casting of Skinner hassunk this ship before it sailed.RIPCORD ** out of **** MANHATTAN THEARE CLUB AT NY CITY CENTERHaving just seen the disappointing Pulitzer Prize winner The Gin Game (a rickety, unsatisfying play that barelyserves as a decent star vehicle), I was both wary of and excited by Ripcord. It's about two retired women anglingover rights to the best bed in the best room at their nursing home. A showcase for two actors sporting bothHolland Taylor and Marylouise Burke? Bring it on! Show 'em how it's done, ladies.Well they do, even if playwright David Lindsay-Abaire doesn't. To be fair, this is no attempt to write somemiddlebrow, well-constructed vehicle. It's a lot weirder than that. David Hyde Pierce directs it with flair momentto moment (he certainly knows how to get laughs). But he needed to be firmer with Lindsay-Abaire and demandone or two or ten more drafts.Quite simply, Abby Binder (Taylor) is not likable. She doesn't want to be likable. And she enjoys her privacy.While she can't afford a private room, the fact is that she's had a double with an unoccupied second bed forquite a while. Abby likes to think it's because the last director of the nursing home appreciated her. When thenursing home employee Scotty (Nate Miller) finally reveals it was just because no one wanted to live with her,well we're hardly surprised.In any case, times have changed. The nursing home has a new director and Abby has a new roommate, whenshe just wants to read her books in peace. Marilyn (Burke) seems blissfully oblivious to Abby's scathing nature.Marilyn talks from morning to night. Marilyn does Sudoku to keep her brain limber. Marilyn is relentlesslycheerful. And Marilyn is awfully admiring of the bed by the window, which gets more sun....A genial bettor about pretty much everything, Marilyn suddenly stumbles into a real wager when she insists shenever gets angry while Abby insists she never gets scared. A light bulb goes off and Abby proposes a bet: she'lltry to get Marilyn angry and Marilyn will try to scare her first. If Abby wins, Marilyn vacates the room. If Marilynwins, they switch beds.You can take it from there. They'll pull increasingly elaborate pranks on one another. Either the pranks grow andgrow into cons worthy of The Sting. Or perhaps they'll become more personal and cutting as these two women</p>

Thecast sells it scene by scene and you can't really feel cheated when getting to watch Taylor and Burke go toe totoe. But the structure of Lindsay-Abaire's showdown is almost perplexingly wrongheaded.First, before the bet even gets underway, the two women attend a local Halloween haunted mansion in whichScotty is working as an actor. It's intended to set up the idea that Abby refuses to admit she gets scared (and ina throw-away bit hint that Abby is not the cold monster she pretends). But this Haunted Mansion segment goeson and on and on. The show is mostly set in that one room of their retirement home. But here we get scene afterscene: they trudge from one silly "scary moment" (like a man getting electrocuted) to another and another. Andanother.They're just repetitive and they go on and on and serve absolutely no purpose. (Remember, this is before thebet has even been made.) How and why this hugely elaborate segment wasn't cut remains puzzling. Cut thisand the interval and you'd have an intermission-free show that could build and build to a climax the way such aseries of escalating pranks should.Then come two pranks on top of each other. One is modest and the other so elaborate and over-the-top andfrankly unbelievable that it feels more like the climax to a very different show. It seems like the prank that mightcome right before the finale. True, the show raises the stakes with more personal pranks after that, ones that cutto the core. But the surreal, nutty nature of that first prank by Marilyn is so outrageous that everything she doesafter it is both predictable and anti-climactic.In a misjudgment of an entirely different nature, Abby unearths distressingly painful information aboutMarilyn...and broadcasts it to the entire retirement home. Now Abby wants to be seen as indifferent to others butshe's hardly a monster. What she does is simply cruel. That would be fine if it led to us seeing her in a differentlight. (Maybe she really is cruel.) Or it would work if Marilyn raised the stakes as well. That doesn't reallyhappen, though the playwright might think it does. Even worse, those details sh uncovers remain essentially athrowaway, a rather callous use of such plot info for mere momentary effect.Glenn Fitzgerald pops in with several small parts and one juicy scene with Taylor, that is gripping and dramatic.It's always a pleasure to see him onstage and he and Taylor are marvelous, but it feels like a scene from a verydifferent show, seeming to almost exist outside the rest of this mostly larky comedy.For all its scattershot nature, Ripcord ends in a very predicable fashion that one expects, given the pranks thathave come before. Lindsay-Abaire had about seven different directions he could have taken this play in.Unfortunately, he took them all.THEATER OF 2015Honeymoon In Vegas ** The Woodsman *** Constellations ** 1/2 Taylor Mac's A 24 Decade History Of Popular Music 1930s-1950s ** 1/2 Let The Right One In ** Da no rating A Month In The Country ** 1/2 Parade in Concert at Lincoln Center ** 1/2 Hamilton at the Public *** The World Of Extreme Happiness ** 1/2 Broadway By The Year 1915-1940 **</p>
