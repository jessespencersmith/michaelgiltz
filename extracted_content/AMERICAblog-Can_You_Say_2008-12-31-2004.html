12/31/2004 09:04:00 AMBush is belatedly sending a high-level delegation to southeastAsia to deal with the impending post-tsunamai disaster. Who isleading the team?

My God, they're actually layingthe groundwork for 2008. Not only was Bush's initial responsedeeply unChristian, his later response is deeply cynical andpolitical.
