It was Found, a zine that celebrated "found" bits of text -- notesleft on cars, shopping lists dropped on the ground, letters discovered inside a second-hand book and so on.They're enigmatic, funny, sad, kind of beautiful. It becomes a public radio-ish sort of success and you do openmike nights where the magazine creatives read out the best of the best and audience members contribute andit's a lot of fun. And somewhere along the way, someone says, this should be a musical!But what kind of musical? Just reading out random scraps of text -- even grouped by category like "love" or"money" -- would grow pretty exhausting. Should they be declaimed? Or set to music? What if you created skitsthat imagined what led to some of these angry, inspiring and sometimes downright bizarre missives? Or createda show about the magazine that incorporated the stuff everyone loved the most?The answer to these questions became: all of the above. Found, with a book by Hunter Bell & the show'sdirector Lee Overtree and music and original lyrics by Eli Bolin, does everything you can think of and more. Theyuse the founding of Found as an excuse to tell a very familiar story about idealism crashing against reality. Andtoss in a lot of snippets of humor from randomly discovered bits of text along the way because that's what got'em there. None of it works very well.The story -- such as it is -- revolves around Davy (a bland but likable Nick Blaemire). He loses his job during ahorrible, no good, very bad day that ends weirdly: by finding an amusingly angry and plaintive note on his carmeant for someone else. The woman who wrote it mistook the car for her lover's, accuses him of cheating onher, declares in no uncertain and foul-mouthed terms that they are through but ends by saying he should pageher later. It's very funny. And the note is unfortunately repeated about eight different times throughout the showas a prime example of what Found is about.Davy talks with his friends Denise (Barrett Wilbert Weed) and Mikey D (Daniel Everidge) about the note andinspired by his passion and a clutch of other scraps they find along the way, the three of them turn this hobbyinto a zine and then into an honest-to-god paying gig, including tours that draw bigger and bigger crowdseverywhere they go. They're doing something they love and having fun doing it!We can't have that, not in a musical. So though Davy makes his interest in Denise clear and she's single andavailable and clearly into him, for some inexplicable reason she doesn't want to take that next step. In walks aTV producer named Kate (Betsy Morgan), who starts dating Davy, insinuates herself on the tour and convinceshim to pitch Found as a TV show a la America's Funniest Home Videos. Will Davy sell out? Will he leave hisfriends out in the cold? Will he and Denise ever act on their feelings?If this story sounds tiresomely familiar, it is. Happily, the show is peppered with quick snippets of notes that</p>

Some notes are set to music and while the music is nevermore than functional, those are far preferable to the forgettable original tunes that barely make an impression atall. More problematically, the longer and more intrusive notes -- however funny on their own -- make you feel theshow is drifting away from the actual story.Found is well over two hours in length. When the show grinds to a halt to enact lengthy sketches that imaginethe story behind certain notes -- such as the drawn-out act one closer "Johnny Tremain" and the act two opener"Cats Are Cats" -- you feel impatient to get back to the actual plot. But when you get back to the actual plot, it'sso uninspired you regret even that. It's the worst of both worlds.Most everyone in the show acts like a jerk at some point: Denise behaves petulantly during their big meetingwith ABC. Davy is insufferable when he wants to blow off magazine signings or tour dates just to hang with hisnew girlfriend or go take "meetings" in LA. Kate does a very bad job of managing expectations for Davy thoughshe could hardly expect him to be quite this clueless. (Is he really aghast that ABC won't air a note completewith multiple F bombs in primetime? For a family show?) Mikey D...well, actually he behaves decentlythroughout.While the songs are generally a bust, the music is delivered nimbly by the musicians on -- or rather under andaround the stage. A definite plus is the choreography by Monica Bill Barnes which is distinctive and odd, withlots of hand movements and silly little moves. It feels like choreography for people who maybe aren't the bestdancers? But it works and has a nice, quirky sensibility ideal for this show.In the main roles, the women are better than the men, with Weed an appealing presence in particular. Since theleads must shoulder the burden of the dull central storyline, it's the ensemble that has the most fun. Danny Pudiand Christina Anthony shine in various parts, with Orville Mendoza and especially the straight-faced goofAndrew Call having a blast as well.But the longer the show goes on, the less interest it maintains. Looking back, one doubts any of the otherapproaches to turning Found into a musical would have been terribly interesting either. Their appreciation forthose little scraps of humanity is sweet. It just didn't need to burst into song.GENERATIONS ** 1/2 out of **** SOHO REP AND THE PLAY COMPANY AT SOHO REPContext is everything. I had friends who went to see Generations based on the terrific recent track record ofSoho Rep and a description of this show that mentioned it was set in a kitchen in South Africa and included a lotof singing. They're veteran theatergoers happy to tackle all sorts of shows both traditional and avant garde. Butwithout any idea this was not a traditional play with music, they were unmoored. Forewarned, I was much betterprepared to appreciate Generations for what it is. But it really does pay to know if you're in for a three hourmusical, a 20 minute Brechtian howl of despair or a 90 minute farce.So let's be clearer than the advance publicity for this intriguing if ultimately opaque work presented with care andintelligence by a talented cast. Generations is a performance piece. It lasts a brief half hour. And while quality isnever linked to quantity, such a short running time is unquestionably good to know in advance. The night Iattended, I stood up and began to go while most everyone else seemed a little confused: was it over? Yes, itwas.The piece by Debbie Tucker Green is an enigmatic one. But the presentation by Soho Rep and The PlayCompany is of the highest order. Rep's space has been turned into a township, complete with a red clay earthenfloor, tin walls with colorful imagery and the suggestion of a crowded, very modest kitchen overflowing withspices and dishes and the usual implements of life. There's a wooden table, a rocking chair and in the center ofthe floor, a working kitchen with food already simmering as the audience comes in.</p>

https://www.evernote.com/Home.action#n=2b354551-5fb9-4ca9-9e66-845da9b9fcbc&ses=4&sh=2&sds=5&3/6People take their admittedly rough seats (sometimes chairs, sometimes merely a milk crate with a cushion) andit's easy to spot what one imagines are cast members scattered among us. (Though the man next to me I easilyspotted as a ringer, the man next to him fooled me genially beforehand by telling the actor I'd spotted that helooked familiar. "Were you in The Lion King?" he asked. I realized how funny that really was when the showbegan and they both stood up and started singing.)The story begins with song, beautifully and captivatingly sung by about a dozen people scattered throughout thespace. It's like being inside a choir and I can only hope my toe-tapping didn't throw off the singer next to me.Then begins a very brief acting out of the text. A young man is courting a young woman and her even youngersister disapproves. The parents of the girls look on amusedly while the grandparents offer their two cents aswell. They've seen it all before. This courtship -- this innocently sexy dance -- revolves around the question ofwhether the young woman can cook, a word that takes on many meanings throughout the night. "I was thecooker -- she was the cookless!" intones the mother at one point.The very modest scraps of dialogue become building blocks. The words are repeated again and again,interrupted by songs. They are playful and then sexy, then serious, then angry, then sad. Despite only a fewlines each at best, the actors are impeccable and create vivid characters and shades of meaning. The implieddaytime setting of the beginning turns to dusk and then nighttime. Actors slowly slip into the crowd until only thegrandparents are left alone, intoning the words one last time before a burst of song lifts you up at the end. Andit's over.Knowing it was only half an hour and that the dialogue was Pinter-esque certainly helped. But I was befuddledwhen my friend afterward insisted they had read about a twist at the end that put the entire evening in a newlight. What had we missed? It turns out that many others have seen the show as a cry from the heart about theravages of AIDS. How one would suss that out strictly from watching the show, I've no idea. But certainly onesensed a certain sadness, though it seemed more universal than AIDS. It might have been the splintering of afamily -- children do move away or find distractions that simply stop them from coming around. Or it might havebeen violence or war. I really didn't get the sense that the people who disappeared from the stage in this briefwork had died so much as just weren't present anymore.Perhaps knowing the lyrics of the songs would have made the purpose of the evening clearer. Were theymourning those who had died? The dialogue was in English but the original songs -- evocatively written andarranged by Bongi Duma -- were not. I'd love to hear them again. I appreciated the care and craft with whichdirector Leah C. Gardiner and her cast and crew offered this work. But without a lot more context (or at leastfootnotes!), Generations seems to me too abstract to register as more than an intellectual framework of an idea.The fact that it inspired those around her to such passionate effort makes me eager to see Green's next effort.But it does not make me eager to send people to this one.THEATER OF 2014Beautiful: The Carole King Musical ***Rodney King *** Hard Times ** 1/2 Rosencrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead ** I Could Say More * The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner ** Machinal *** Outside Mullingar *** A Man's A Man * 1/2 The Tribute Artist ** 1/2 Transport **</p>
