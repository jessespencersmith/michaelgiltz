            <p>W E D N E S D AY,  M AY  1 7 ,  2 0 0 6Trade Tidbits, Wandering AroundI head over to the American Pavilion. I've never even walked in therebefore, but a persistent email prompted me to register and see whatthey had to offer. Guarding the door was a gang of teenagers -- maybehigh school, maybe college. They're all wearing green t-shirts and directyou where to go en masse. Imagine getting to come to Cannes whenyou're in high school or just in college. What a blast.Woody Allen's next movie is going to be made in London again. Thetrades say it was scheduled to be shot in Paris; I remember it beingSpain. In any case, it will cost $20.8 million, stars Ewan mcGregor andColin Farrel and Tom Wilkinson and is described as "Match Point"meets Hitchcok, which is a tad redundant, isn't it?Ian McKellen will be doing King Lear next year in London, presumablyat the National. I still bitterly regret missing Ian Holm's Lear. I hadtickets but spent the day with author Philip Pullman in Oxford and ittook too long to get back to London. The happyb result: I stumbled onreally cheap tickets to see Blue Nile in concert -- a band that almostnever performs in concert, so the rarity of it almost made up formissing Holm.Cannes organizers chose from 1520 movies to find some 50 films beingshown in and out of competition. (Thousands of movies are screenedone way or another at the market, the Director's Fortnight and so on.)And the "Carry On..." films, which are namechecked in Alan Bennett'smarvelously fun play "The History Boys, continue with film #32 set tobe "Carry On London." They'v been making these flicks since 1958 andthey never got around to "Carry On London" till now?POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
