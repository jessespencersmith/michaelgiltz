9/09/2005 03:22:00 PMScott McClellan is lying in his daily press conference. He liesagain in claiming that everyone believed "New Orleans DodgedA Bullet." In fact, the only media outlet we could find with thatheadline was the far right religious website WorldNet Daily.Here's a link to the headlines Tuesday morning -- all of themsay "Devastation!" and the like. Even Stars & Stripes -- themilitary paper -- spoke of the tremendous disaster. The leveesbroke Monday morning. It was announced Monday afternoon at2 p.m. And as one reporter asked Scotty, "Does the Presidentrely on news headlines?"Someone -- it seems right up Tim Russert's alley -- do amock-up of all the headlines and shove it in their faces and getthem to respond to this lie. Also, just caught the tail-end ofScotty's dismissal of the Time magazine story about Brown'slie-packed resume. I can't understand why there weren't 50questions about this (maybe I missed most of them) anddemands for documentation to back up Brown's claims if he'ssimply going to insist everyone else is lying at Edmond localgovernment, Central State University and the IndependentElectrical Contractors.
