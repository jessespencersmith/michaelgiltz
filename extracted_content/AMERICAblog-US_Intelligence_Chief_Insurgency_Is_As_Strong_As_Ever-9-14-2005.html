9/14/2005 04:49:00 PMEveryone agrees the insurgency in Iraq is stronger than ever --they're killing more people this year than last year and killedmore people last year than the year before. But JohnNegroponte -- the intelligence czar -- tries to downplay thatfact by narrowing his focus to the last few months and puttingthe least offensive spin on the facts that he can:"Putting numbers on the size of the insurgency is probablya bit of a speculative business because nobody knows forsure. But I guess I'd say that based on what I've read andon my own knowledge of the situation in Iraq, that overthe past several months I don't think the size ornature of the insurgency has changed appreciably."How many ways can we slice this? Saying the "size or nature" of theinsurgency hasn't changed appreciably is another way of saying Bushis completely failing in his attempt to attack and weaken theinsurgency. Negroponte could have said the insurgency is as strongas it's ever been, but Bush wouldn't have liked that.One thing is clear: an intelligence czar who tries to downplay or blandout clear and accurate estimates of threats to a stable Iraq is not onethat inspires confidence.
