4/14/2005 10:16:00 PMThe Washington Post is painting it as almost inevitable thatSen. Majority leader Bill Frist is going to nuclear and forcethrough rule changes ending the fillibuster option and allowingthe approval of Supreme Court judges and other appointeeswith just a simple majority.I don't care whether the Dems have 58 Senators and thePresidency or the Republicans have 59 Senators and thePresidency -- I would hate for EITHER party to approve aSupreme Court justice who couldn't garner the respect andvote of at least 60 senators. It's amazing Frist wants to makethem even less accountable to the people and their dulyelected representatives than they are now.So what are we gonna do about it? Me, I'm gonna send a politeemail to all 100 senators telling them I am a moderate, acentrist, and I'm sick and tired of them catering to fringeactivists and that this sort of dramatic rule change is simplyunacceptable.
