Your Thoughts on Kerry's Speech -- Open
Thread
by Michael in New York  on 7/29/2004 10:48:00 PM
My first impression:  a number  of little stumbles over words,
especially when evoking his mother and father early on. Fascinating
to see his biggest applause lines: a dig at the Saudi Royal family,promising not to politicize the Constitution, and quoting AbrahamLincoln on God (we shouldn't claim God is on our side but ratherhumbly pray that we are on His). Most important, he was verypassionate and human and convincing in calling our nation to its
better angels. He was strong on specifics and almost Reaganesque in
evoking the optimism and promise of what can be accomplishedwhen Americans come together. Not great rhetoric, perhaps, but agreat image booster for him.
