Gay faves 
at Cannes 
A checklist of the gay successes 
on the Croisette at the 2005 
Cannes Film Festival 
Living celebrities were all over the place, but this 
year the Cannes Film Festival belonged to James 
Dean. Posters sporting his image dotted the 
Croisette ; East of Eden and Rebel Without a Cause 
screened in the festival and on the beach late at 
night for the public. And a documentary about 
Dean's life-which is included in the new DVD boxed 
set of his films-had a sold-out screening. Other 
than Dean, who might have come out had he lived 
longer, lots of the festival thrills involved gay films 
and filmmakers. A few highlights: 
54 July 5,2005 Last Days by Gus Van 
Sant: This meditation 
on the demise of Kurt 
Cobain ends the nonlin­
ear series of art films 
Van Sant began with 
Gerry and continued 
with Elephant, which 
won the Palme D'Or in 
2003. The Museum of 
Modern Art in New York announced it would 
screen all three on July 
20-a nice capper for 
Van Santo 
Where the Truth Lies by 
Atom Egoyan: The 
Canadian auteur's new 
mystery split critics, but 
everyone agreed that a 
very steamy lesbian 
encounter for Alison 
Lohman (not to men­
tion the nudity of stars 
Kevin Bacon and Colin 
Firth) would fascinate 
the MPAA. 
Odete by Joao Pedro 
Rodrigue s: An almost 
campy Portuguese film 
by the director of 0 Fan­
tasma. The story about 
a man mourning his gay 
lover echoes Vertigo but 
is most convincing 
when displaying the 
sexy cast, especially 
star Nuno Gil. Time to Leave by 
Fran~oi s Ozon: This 
lovely chamber piece 
about a rude gay fash­
ion photographer who 
finds out he has only 
months to live is a 
return to the haunting 
style of Under the Sand. 
Midnight Movies: From 
the Margin to the Main­
stream by Stuart 
Samuels: Documentary 
on how movies like Pink 
Flamingos and The 
Rocky Horror Picture 
Show changed Holly­
wood films. John Waters 
is hilarious in interviews, 
but even better is the 
archival footage of him 
coaching Divine. 
Volver by Pedro Almo­
d6var: The already leg­
endary Spanish director 
returns to comedy with 
stars Carmen Maura 
and Penelope Cruz. And 
in 2006 eight Almod6-
var classics-including 
Women on the Verge of 
a Nervous Breakdown, 
Law of Desire, Bad Edu­
cation, and Talk to Her­
will be rereleased in the 
United States, then 
packaged as a DVD 
boxed set.
