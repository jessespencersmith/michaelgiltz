By MICHAEL GIL TZ 
IF the stiff, unloved ani­
mated cartoon "Space 
Ghost" can be turned 
into a drolly amusing talk 
show. there's no reason 
why hand puppet Alf -
star of his own wildly suc­
cessful, albeit short-lived, 
sitcom -shouldn't get to 
host his own talk show, 
too. 
lt debuts tonight at 10 
p.m on TV Land, and he's 
even ~ot Ed McMahon 
out 01 cold storage to 
s~rve as a sidekick. 
An instant pop cultural 
smash when it debuted in 
1986, "Alr' spawned an 
animated cartoon of its 
own, books about the life 
of Alf (an Alien Life Form 
from the planet Melmac) 
and all sorts of merchan­
dising. It peaked in the 
Top 10 and then disap­
peared_ 
BlIt All', a comic with a 
bOI scht belt sensibility, 
found a secund life as an 
advertising pitchman , and 
now he's hosting" AU's 
Hit Talk Show," talking 
to Dennis Franz and fel· 
low washed-up sitcom 
star Drew Carey -with 
special appearances by 
Henry Winkler and Joan 
Rivers. 
In other words, it's an 
entire show devoted to 
proving that in America 
everyone gets a second 
act. 
We chatted with him by 
email this week: 
Q; Choosing to do inter­
views only by email is 
pretty Garbo-esque of 
you -have you be­
come a bit of a recluse? 
A: Being a recluse has 
nothing to do with it. Semi-intelligent life form 
tells all about talk show 
TrlIth is, my phone got 
shut off. Now that I'm 
back at work with this 
new talk show, I'll be cor­
recting that problem. Is 
there a number 1 can 
reach you at? 
Q; Your age -you're 
now 247 years old, 
right? 
A: Honestly, I stopped 
counting after I hit the 
big 2·0·0. Joan Collins 
gave me that wise advice 
over 80 years ago. I'll al­
ways remember it. 
Q; Any problems of 
being an illegal alien in 
the U.S. or were you 
naturalized a Icng time 
ago? 
A: Let me set you straight 
on Ihis. In the United 
States, there's a big dif· 
ference between being 
an Alien from Outer 
Space and an "illegal" 
alien. The illegal aliens 
get medical and educa­
tional henefits. I get 
nothing. 
Q; How will your ap­
proach be different 
from other TV talk 
show hosts? Sarcasm 
seems the coin of the 
realm in late night these 
days. 
A: I think sarcasm has 
run its course, It's way 
overdon e. I hope to 
raise the benchmark 
all talk shows 
and substitute sarcasm with slander. 
Haaaaa. 
Q: Which talk show 
host do you most ad­
mire and why? 
A: It's a tough Question , 
but if I had to pick one, 
I'd say that Sally Jesse is 
still doing a good job. 
That woman never fails 
to make me laugh. 
Q; I'm sure you're 
quickly becoming 
aware of the booking 
wars on talk shows. 
How can you gain an 
edge on your oppo­
nents? 
~'.';i'"t.'l. 
... \" 
. :f.;'jf" A: I am opposed to any 
kind of war, .. especially 
booking W~HS. Violence is 
no way to settle things ... 
especi-all y with talk 
shows. I'd like to see a 
DMZ zone for talk show 
guests It would provide a 
safe haven for whatever 
choices they make reo 
garding television ap-. 
pearances . I mean sefl­
ouslv .•. can't we all just 
get along? . 
Q: Will there be cats 
available for snacking 
in the Green Room? 
A: A lot of shows have 
been serving eat­
based snacks in 
their green looms 
for years without 
anyone knowing. 
C'mon, what do 
you think is the 
main ingredient in 
the famous "To· 
night Show Pate?" 
Q: Any grudges 
against celebri­
ties who loved 
you when you 
were on top 
but wouldn't 
return your 
" calls lately? 
A: As you know, Holly\vood is a 'II 
fickle town Erik Estrada 
and I talk abuut this all 
the time. 1 would love to 
give you the names of all 
those two-faced, back­
stabbing, insincere celeb· 
rities who shunned me ... 
but now that I have a 
show to book. I wQulun't _ 
want to upset them. . ... ~. 
Q; Normally, we don't .. -
deal in tabloid rumors, 
but the reports about 
your stints at Betty 
Ford and claims that it 
was just an "addiction 
to painkillers" have 
been so widespread. 
Want to talk about 
these rumors? 
A: I think you're confus­
ing me with Courtney 
Love, although in the mid 
'SOs I did have an addic­
tion to cotton. ThJnk­
fullv. I wa' introouceu to 
Rayon and other syn­
thetic hlends. and I can 
honestly say that as of 
Ihis day I am completely <a 
cotton frer. 
Q; Any activity in your 
love life? 
A: Are you referring to 
activity that I don't have 
to pay for? 
Q: Do you have a fea­
ture mm in the works? 
A: I don·t want to jinx it, 
h\n I'm up for the lead 
role in the Herve Ville­
ehaize story.
