 Cannes 2009 Day Seven: More
Almodovar Is Less
Read More:  Cannes Film Festival, Ewan McGregor, Jim
Carrey , Movies, Pedro Almodovar , Entertainment News
A quiet day movie-wise -- I only saw three films,
mostly because I wasted five hours trying to
resolve some WiFi problems so I could actually
file stories...and then spent the rest of the timewriting stories so I could file them.
Broken Embrace  ** (out of four) -- Pedro
Almodovar has given me great pleasure over the
years and so it's always a thrill to see a new
movie of his. He's had very good films in hisearly, middle and mature years, whereas most
directors peak creatively during one crucial
period (a la Coppola in the '70s). But Broken Embraces  is fading from memory just hours after I
saw it and is so slight that several critics and I had the same reaction: we quizzed each other about
the twists in the film, wondering if we'd missed something. Was that all there was to it? Yep. In it,
the commanding Penelope Cruz (really still coming into her own as an actress and star) plays the
secretary to a powerful man. With an ailing father, she is compromised into becoming his mistress.Meanwhile, many years later we get the story of the film director who fell in love with her during
the making of her first (and only) movie. The director is now blind, his single assistant has a son
with an absent mysterious father (hmmm), and the powerful man's gay son now calls himself RayX and wants to make a film with the blind director turned writer. A light melodrama, none of thesoapy elements here will sound surprising or unexpected. What is unexpected is how little is done
with it. Even fans of Almodovar will be nonplussed by the story. Why do artists so often assume
their mature years should be devoted to serious work? Two stories within the story here indicatethat -- if it interested him enough -- Almodovar could make a great comedy or genre piece that
would be tremendous fun. The son of the assistant describes the plot for a vampire movie that
sounds hilarious. And then we see what seems like roughly five minutes of the movie within themovie called Girls With Suitcases,  which is an homage to Women On The Verge Of A Nervous
Breakdown. Both of these glimpses of other projects are far lighter and funnier and more
compelling than anything else in the film. Show me that  movie is the invariable response of the

<p>Michael Giltz: Cannes 2009 Day Seven: More Almodovar Is Less

audience. You can grow older without growing up; it's a pity Almodovar hasn't learned that yet.
Les Herbes Folles  * 1/2 -- Director Alain Resnais has delivered one of the most perplexing films
of the fest. Lars Von Trier's Anti-Christ has nothing on this one when it comes to throwing the
audience for a loop. One hour into this film, I defy anyone to describe it accurately and know where
it's headed. Is it a light, witty romantic comedy; a searching drama; a nihilistic fable and/or asatire of any or all of these? It begins with playful narration describing a woman who is buying
shoes only to have her purse stolen. That purse is discovered by a mature gentleman who hesitates,
picks it up and takes it to the police. Very small moments can lead to momentous changes, we aretold (again and again and again). The man becomes mildly obsessed with the woman. Then thewoman becomes obsessed with the man. Then they both turn on each other (though never at thesame time). The wife of the man is of course at least 30 years younger and stunningly beautiful and
yet still doesn't blink an eye when his mistress comes over for a chat. This is a French film after all.
And constantly the mood is changing. A playful moment is followed by a harshly real moment of
emotion and pain which is followed by something entirely else. And it all ends on a completely
discontinuous, seemingly unrelated and very brief moment that left everyone shaking their headsin confusion. Some of the French partisans in the audience applauded but no one booed becausethey were still so bewildered. Here is my explanation:
Spoiler SpoilerIn the last scene, a small plane with our main characters is plunging out of control towards the
earth. Suddenly, the camera zooms over the landscape and into a home where a little girl is askingher mother if -- when she comes back in another life as a cat -- she can have some cat treats. And
the film ends. I should add, several other scenes in the last few minutes included "Fin!"
prominently displayed on the screen so no one can be blamed for not being certain when the movieactually did come to a halt. The only explanation for this moment is to show the little girl's life cut
short. Her time has ended just as the lives of the people in the plane ended. And why? Because the
zipper on some pants broke. (That led to complications which led to the seeming crash.) See? Thetiniest incident can change your world. That may not be an accurate reading but it's the only onewe can think of and is the only way to put this fitfully amusing but confused trifle to rest.
End of Spoiler End of SpoilerI Love You, Phillip Morris  ** -- Is it possible to over-emphasize chemistry? It's a magical
blending of two actors that can't really be predicted even with screen tests and readings. You just
never know. This film by the writers of Bad Santa  stars Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor as two
prison inmates who fall in love. Carrey is an inveterate con man and gives McGregor the lavish life
Carrey believes they deserve. But Carrey's illegal activities keep getting him thrown into jail andkept away from his love. That's unacceptable so he begins a series of clever prison escapes that
made him famous and shamed the Texas jail system to no end. Did I mention this really happened?
Skipping blithely between comedy and drama, the film has some clever sequences and great scams.But through no fault of their own, I never bought that Carrey and McGregor were lovers. It's not
out of any fear from them about getting physical; they just don't have any spark. Without that
passion (which was also missing for me from the John Keats biopic Bright Star  -- and a more
dissimilar love story would be hard to name), nothing really matters. But the film does have somevery fun moments, including mockeries of golf and Texas that won't be forgotten any time soon.
