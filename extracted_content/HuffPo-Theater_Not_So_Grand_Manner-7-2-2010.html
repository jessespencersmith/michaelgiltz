THE GRAND MANNER  ** out of ****
By A.R. Gurney
At Lincoln Center
Sometimes, a mildly pleasant night at the theater can't
quite be recommended. Such is the case,
unfortunately, for A.R. Gurney's The Grand Manner,
a modest little comedy that serves as an ode to theaterin general and Katharine Cornell in particular. It
features a marvelous cast, some amusing moments,
and just the right setting (the intimate Mitzi E.Newhouse stage) to squeeze maximum enjoyment out
of very little play.
The set-up is quite winning. Pete ( Bobby Steggert ) steps forward to describe his one and only backstage
meeting in 1948 with the First Lady of the Theater, Katharine Cornell,  who grew up in the same
hometown as Pete, the decidedly unglamorous Buffalo. In about four minutes, it's over: he waits for
Cornell, she chats with him politely, signs his program and then he leaves.

<p>But Pete -- the stand-in for Gurney -- admits the moment had such impact on him, setting the high
school student on the road to playwriting, that he can't help embellishing. And it starts all over again, this
time with Pete dealing with Cornell's assistant (Brenda Wehle) who is determined to keep the star in a
positive frame of mind; Cornell's gay husband (Boyd Gaines), who finds the young man comely enough tooffer him a job for the summer that mostly seems to involve skinny-dipping; and Cornell herself (Kate
Burton), who agonizes over her performance and feels old hat compared to newcomers like Marlon
Brando and yearns to have this boy tell her she still matters.
The set-up seems to cry out for a larger than life presence, an actress  who never stops acting and chews
up the backstage as easily as she does the scenery onstage. Burton utterly avoids that easy trap. Cornell is
just as hungry for praise and affirmation as any star, but she's not an egomaniac, not a monster, not evena lovable one. That sacrifice of easy laughs allows the play to actually seem like a play, rather than a
vehicle for grandstanding. Burton is solid. Gaines as always is effortless. And while Wehle seems more
like a good friend than the lover of Cornell she is revealed as, Wehle has a sharp intelligence on stage thatkeeps the smallest of the four roles well defined.
And then there's Steggert. His role is straightforward: the acolyte overwhelmed by his first taste of
theater people but someone we must believe will someday take his place alongside them. But simple rolesare especially tricky to play, especially when you're playing a nice guy. Steggert is so comfortable onstage
we're willingly drawn in to this sliver of a story as if it really mattered. This actor, who can be as
complicated and driven as anyone (see his Tony nomination for Ragtime ), delivers a performance of
winning modesty, which is the only way a play as modest as The Grand Manner  could work on any level.
I can't recommend the show, though it might well prove catnip for Lincoln Center's older audience,
especially in its current setting. But the chance to see Steggert ( next up on Broadway in Yank! ) is always
welcome.
****
I'm always fascinated by curtain calls: the endless variations on taking a bow, the attitude of actors
ranging from shyness to -- my favorite -- the false modesty of those who love applause best. In this show,
I was a bit astonished to see Steggert be the last to come on stage, when one assumed it would be Burton,
even though it's clearly his character's story and he is onstage throughout. It was a nice acknowledgmentof Steggert's rising profile. And the primacy of the star wasn't completely forgotten: Burton was the last to
leave the stage and took one final, grand bow on her own.
