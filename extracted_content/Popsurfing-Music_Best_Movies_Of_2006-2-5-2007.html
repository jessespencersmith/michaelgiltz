            <p>M O N D AY,  F E B R U A RY  0 5 ,  2 0 0 7Best Movies Of 2006In New York City, 626 films were released in 2006. So far, I've seen 126of them. I rarely say this, but it's been a weak year for movies. I rarelysay that because usually I've been to film festivals and seen so manylittle films at art houses and on DVD that I think there's plenty to getexcited about, even if Hollywood falls short.
