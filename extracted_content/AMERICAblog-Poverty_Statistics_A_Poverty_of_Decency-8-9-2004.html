8/09/2004 05:44:00 PMRoll Call is reporting a series of concerning issues surrounding theupcoming release of poverty statistics by the Census Bureau."By Ethan WallisonRoll Call August 9, 2004.....The bureau’s plan moved this year’s release date from lateSeptember to late August — a time when Members of Congress arenormally home in their districts and many journalists are on vacation.Then last week, Census officials announced yet another change: Forwhat appears to be the first time, the figures will be released not by acareer official but by the bureau’s director, a political appointee. WhileCongressional Democrats emphasize that the director, CharlesKincannon, has always treated them fairly and honestly, the changeadded to the feeling that some kind of hijinks was going on. "Apolitical appointee should not be delivering such a significant statistic,because it opens the Census Bureau to charges of spinning statisticsfor political purposes," said Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.).Wanna bet these numbers are really, really bad?
