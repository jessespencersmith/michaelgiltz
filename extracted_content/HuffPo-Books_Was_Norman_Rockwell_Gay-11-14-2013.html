AMERICAN  MIRROR:  THE  LIFE  AND  ART  OF  NORMAN  ROCKWELL
CITY  OF  NIGHTHAPPINESS:  A  VERY  SHORT  INTRODUCTION
AMERICAN  MIRROR:  THE  LIFE  AND  ART  OFNORMAN  ROCKWELLBY DEBORAH SOLOMON$28; Farrar, Straus and Giroux
This major look at the work of illustrator
Norman Rockwell  is a sober, serious, thoughtful
analysis of a significant artist and how his lifeinfluenced his work. But that doesn't mean areview of the book need maintain such highstandards. Whenever anyone asked what I wasreading, I said "a biography of NormanRockwell" and immediately added, "It turns outhe was probably gay, even if Rockwell himself
didn't quite realize it." Oh really, they perked
up?
Author and critic Deborah Solomon's book
doesn't belabor the point or make too much of
it, or to be more precise doesn't turn it into
gossip. Like me, she doesn't find the idea
shocking nor downplay what it might mean. But the man who symbolized Americanheartland values spent decades in therapy and rarely attended religious services? Hadthree marriages that were almost comical in their abruptness? (Rockwell didn't havemarriages of convenience so much as convenient marriages.) Two of them at least wereunhappy and the third came at such a late stage that it was far more about companionshipthan anything else, if indeed the others were anything more either.
Suddenly, the details pile up. A close look at some of Rockwell's work reveals an
unconscious homoerotic subtext. He had intense male friendships and personal diariesreinforce this idea. He focused again and again on adolescent boys in his paintings andoften dropped the teens without a second glance once the models he used became too oldto interest him anymore.
Does it matter? Of course it matters, just as the gender or the race of an artist matters. It
is fundamental to who they are as a person and informs their art on many levels, whetheror not that artist address gender or race or sexuality in their work. And of course it doesn'tmatter, really, though when writing a biography it's certainly essential to grasp such amajor possibility, even if the person themselves remained blinkered to it. Did Rockwellever act on what seems to be his natural inclination? There's no smoking gun and it seemsdoubtful; his was an arrested adolescence, enamored of boyhood and extended to his diet:

<p>Rockwell hated vegetables and liked nothing more than a scoop of Breyer's vanilla ice
cream for dessert. Still the possibility of a thwarted nature shadows his life and puts his
rather sad private existence in a new light.
Rockwell is seen as embodying the American family, but as Solomon points out, the
American family as a unit is almost never portrayed in his work. It's the community, thecivic family that dominates and Rockwell expressed an urge to... not blindly conform  as
was so often assumed during his lifetime but to belong , to participate, to fit in and
achieve normalcy, which is a very different desire from conforming. This takes on a moreplaintive aspect if one believes that Rockwell couldn't even be comfortable in his own skin.Happily, any suppressed desires didn't manifest themselves in inappropriate conduct withthe countless boys he worked with over the years -- always a possibility when anyone ofany orientation tamps down something as primal as sexual desire. Sadly, Rockwell himselfwould probably be astonished and confused and embarrassed by everything I just blithely
speculated about him. He belonged to an era and a mindset where such things were
simply unimaginable.
Solomon's work is far more all-encompassing than the passages I just focused on, though
her clear analysis of his artwork proved very convincing to me. (And not just in obviousexamples like this one.)
Indeed, Solomon's
biography is fascinating
and empatheticthroughout, beginning
with the artistic impulses
that arose with his
ancestors to a childhood
overshadowed by his
handsome, athletic olderbrother. He came of ageduring a golden period forillustrators, when theywould work on illustratingclassic works forpublishers, provideexcellent artwork formagazines before theheyday of the photographand of course make moneyin advertising. Rockwellbefriended the greatLeyendecker brothers, who
lived spinster-like in a mansion in New Rochelle. J.C. Leyendecker created the iconicArrow Collar Man and took the model most associated with that campaign for his lifelonglove. Rockwell would always value their friendship and mentoring during his early years,paying it back in loyalty over time.
And here I'm getting ahead of myself and the most admirable fact about American
Mirror.  Rockwell was just 22 when he first created a cover for the Saturday  Evening  Post
and he'd already had work appear in exhibitions and been written about as a rising talentbefore befriending the Leyendeckers. He enjoyed essentially unbroken commercial successhis entire life. Yes, he had the usual travails of life -- deaths, divorce, distant relations withsome of his children -- but it's basically the story of a commercially successful man whoworked at his task for decades while enjoying increasing popular support and seeminglyunbothered by the lack of critical appreciation.
Despite this smooth sailing, Solomon creates a compelling book out of what is a not
terribly compelling life. She accomplishes this by focusing on his art; how it wasaccomplished, how he grew and how his work is far more interesting than a casual glance
that gets the "joke" or story of his one-panel tales might suggest. The descriptions of how</p>
<p>he used props and varied details to create the tableaux of his covers are fascinating.
Rockwell was very forthcoming about how he'd take live models, pose them and then takepictures so he could work at his leisure to get the specifics just right. This was seen ascheating somehow -- shouldn't real artists not have to use photography to do a painting?But of course now we know how often the masters used similar techniques of mirroringreal props to achieve their effects and Rockwell can take his place among artists who usetechnology not to cut corners but to refine their craft.
His success was so broad and middle-brow, it may take another generation or two for all
the hype both for and against Rockwell to calm down and let his work be judged strictly
on its merit. Surely the greatest blow is that so much of it has apparently been lost, one of
the side effects of being a "mere" illustrator whose cover art displayed on magazines went
into the trash after that week's issue had been read. Few thought to treat the originals
with any more care. Thanks to Solomon, we can see how intriguing and complex that work
truly was and begin to appreciate it not just for its humor or the hidden clues it reveals
about its author but for their unquestioned skill and layers of meaning that say more
about America than perhaps even Rockwell realized at the time.
CITY  OF  NIGHT  50TH  ANNIVERSARYEDITION
BY JOHN RECHY
$16; Grove Press
In the early 1960s, Norman Rockwell had
married his third and final wife and wasworking on his Civil Rights masterpiece TheProblem We All Live With.  I'd be astonished to
hear he was even aware of the publication ofJohn Rechy's City  Of  Night  in 1963. A novel
about a "youngman" -- a young male hustlertraveling the country -- that was written in astream of consciousness style that disparagedmiddle class values and apostrophes with equalabandon? It's hard to imagine anything furtherfrom his experience than the seedy, desperateworld depicted by Rechy, who scandalized andintrigued the media by continuing to hustleeven after he was a published author.
Rechy wrote other books dealing with hustlers and the coming apocalypse that was AIDSbut it's his memoir/novel about sex workers as they're known today that remains hislegacy. It falls in the Beat category though Rechy didn't know the Beats at the time andwasn't influenced by them. Still, it's a clear companion piece to On  The  Road  and can now
be read as a novel rather than for some in days gone by as a how-to guide for anyone newto a big city and short on cash.
It's been praised by the likes of Gore Vidal and James Baldwin in the past and now
continues to reap praise from Michael Cunningham, Edmund White and others. It willappeal to those who like the bleak landscapes of books like Last  Exit  To  Brooklyn  and
Naked  Lunch.  This new edition contains a letter from Baldwin praising the book, a 1984
introduction by the author, a new afterword by the author, facsimiles of galley pages andan interview from Vice  magazine by Steve Lafreniere. If only the cover had been illustrated
by Rockwell.
HAPPINESS:  A  VERY  SHORTINTRODUCTIONBY DANIEL M. HAYBRON
$11.95; Oxford University Press</p>
<p>One can imagine John Rechy or Norman
Rockwell perusing and benefiting from
Happiness:  A  Very  Short  Introduction.  The
latest in the welcome and erudite "A Very Short
Introduction" series, this one is written byDaniel M. Haybron, a professor of philosophy atSt. Louis University. In a very brisk 147 pages
(the book is in a small, portable format),
Haybron introduces the idea of happiness,
suggests we should be the happiest people in
history (we live longer, are healthier and
wealthier by every standard, are better
educated, can see more of the world, etc. etc.)
and then explains why this is not so and why.
You're led gently by the hand and before you
know it grappling with some interesting philosophical concepts via concrete and
understandable examples that are explained lucidly even for novices like me who don'tknow a Schopenhauer from a Spinoza. Undoubtedly, Rockwell would have just returned tohis painting and Rechy to his clients or companions, but they'd at least have food forthought. You will too.
