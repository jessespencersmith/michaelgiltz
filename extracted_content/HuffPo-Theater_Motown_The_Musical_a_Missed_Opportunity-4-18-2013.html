MOTOWN:  THE  MUSICAL  ** out of ****
LUNT  FONTANNE  THEATRE
This musical begins in the home of Motown founder Berry Gordy in Los Angeles in 1983.
Gordy debates whether or not to show up for the taping of a TV special honoring the 25th
anniversary of his iconic label. (As if.) We see Gordy grumbling in a shabby little wood-paneled living room even though Gordy would sell the label for $61 million just five yearslater. In the set design by David Korins, a color TV is downstage, its bulky, unattractiveback jutting out towards the audience. Who wants to see the back of a TV? No one.
Motown  The  Musical  has the same problem as this set. Who wants to see the ugly
backside of a record label? The book by Gordy -- based on his own, self-serving memoir --
is filled with deals and contracts and who is suing who and who broke their contract whenand why. What you don't see is the artistic birth of a song, the famous molding of acts orsingers coming into their own.
We get obvious moments like Gordy tossing out ideas about what to call his new record
company and a good joke about Smokey Robinson following up his #1 hit "My Guy" witha new song called "My Girl." But the joy of music is almost always overshadowed bymoney, with Gordy invariably the put-upon maestro who just wanted to be a big familyand always treated everyone fairly. Smokey (Charl Brown) seems like a lackey here ratherthan the key top executive who helped run Motown. If a songwriting team sues Gordy,they're being tempted into it by greedy lawyers. Gordy might sue to get them back, but it'sdone out of love. Their lawsuits, on the other hand, are nasty and personal. (The truth isthat Gordy was probably no worse than most other record label executives at the time thatmade tons of money off their acts and reaped most of the rewards -- but he certainlywasn't any better.)
Real-life assistants get name-checked as if the show were one long acknowledgments
page, Diana Ross gets groomed for superstardom, a pint-sized Michael Jackson and the
Jackson 5 wow in an audition and the signposts of an era inevitably rush by. (It's awful to
sigh in boredom when JFK's assassination occurs but that's how pro forma it feels here.)Lost amidst Gordy's life story from little boy to embittered millionaire? The music.May 8, 2014

<p>Motown:  The  Musical  features three new songs co-written by Gordy and Michael
Lovesmith, all of them banal showstoppers in the wrong sense of the word. "Hey Joe
(Black Like Me)" is about the celebration of boxer Joe Louis, followed immediately bybromides from Gordy's father urging his son to "be the best you that you can be." Anothertune -- "It's What's in the Grooves That Counts" -- demonstrates exactly what it's saying,as in this song is not a hit. Finally, Gordy's 11:00 o'clock number is a bombastic "Can IClose The Door." Brandon Victor Dixon has the thankless role of embodying Gordy andsinging some of these numbers, as well as chiming in on various other tunes. Certainly a
compelling work of art could be made out of Gordy's fascinating career, but Gordy himself
is not the person to tell it.
Valisia Lekae has the even more daunting task of embodying Diana Ross. She does well in
the acting scenes and comes into her own in a solo turn on "Reach Out And Touch" whereshe gamely interacts with the audience in full diva mode. Obviously, none of the manytalented performers on stage can hold a candle to the legends or classic recordings they'retackling. But they are talented and the durability of those same classics make theirperformances entertaining. What's remarkable is how often the book by Gordy andinevitably the staging by director Charles Randolph-Wright get in the way of those songs.
Hearing a tune performed completely or given a full-on musical treatment (like Act One
highlight "Dancing In The Street") is a bizarrely rare occurrence.
More often you get a glimpse of life at Motown, such as the weekly meetings where the
staff voted on new tunes. The no-hit Supremes became a running joke until they finallyclick on a hit. The trio strides confidently on stage, clapping their hands and delivering theinstant classic "Where Did Our Love Go." Then it stops and a new scene begins, then thesong picks up in the middle, then another scene intrudes and then the song finally ends.If you're looking for a way to leech the excitement out of a great pop song, that's how todo it. This happens again and again to song after song, making Motown:  The  Musical  one
of the most frustrating shows around. It's bursting with great songs but someone keepschanging the dial on the radio before they're over.
The audience didn't seem to mind so much. They gave entrance applause to some of the
little known cast, not because they were fans of the actors: they were applauding themusical legends those actors were portraying. When Raymond Luke Jr. comes out asMichael jackson in those awesome early 1970s outfits and he and the Jackson Five launchinto a medley of their early hits, the immediate charge pulsing through the crowd wasn'tjust for a young actor who could sing and dance with aplomb. It was for the real MichaelJackson and best of all the young Michael Jackson before his complicated private lifemade it harder to celebrate his musical genius. That medley is unquestionably anotherhighlight, along with "Do You Love Me" by the Contours.
It seems funny to wish a show were less ambitious. But if only Motown:  The  Musical  had
simply created the greatest Motown revue that never happened, a fantasy concert that just
let one act after another come out on stage and deliver their hits. They wouldn't even needto bother with a voice of God narration telling the story of Motown. Just give us the hits.
The costumes by Esosa are great fun and combine with the choreography of Patricia
Wilcox & Warren Adams and the lighting of Natasha Katz to recreate the Motown lookwith loving fidelity. They could have added and subtracted songs in this revue as newtalent was cast in various roles -- God knows Motown has the catalog to do it. Found agreat ringer for Levi Stubbs? Add in more Four Tops! One year after it opened they mightbe playing 50% different songs than on opening night. And after an evening of completeperformances of great songs, a final medley cramming in even more hits would actually bewelcome.
Instead we have this overlong, grudge-settling, Gordy-glorifying musical. It's the B side to
the crowd-pleasing jukebox entertainment that might have been.
