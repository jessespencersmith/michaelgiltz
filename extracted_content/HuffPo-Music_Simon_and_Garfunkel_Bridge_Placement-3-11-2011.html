Maybe the proliferation of computer-generated
imagery in contemporary film has so inured us tovisual magic that we don't even appreciate what a
miracle Jonathan Liebesman's Battle Los Angeles
is.

Rare is the movie that loses points for being too
realistic. But Jonathan Liebesman's alien invasionpicture feels less like an epic and more like a
genuinely plausible war picture.

A major problem with Spider-Man  is that the
scenes are mis-punctuated. This is a problem with
much of Taymor's work: She creates visually
stunning pictures, but often character developmentseems like an afterthought.
