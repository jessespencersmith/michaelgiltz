Gay strings 
Master puppeteer Ronnie Burkett tells how he brought his wild cast 
of gay characters to life amid a turbulent year of his own By Michael Gillz 
Canadian artist 
Ronnie Burkett 
is trying to an­
swer that age­
old question: 
Was he born a pup­
peteer, or was it because 
of the environment he 
grew up in? "It certainly 
wasn't the way I was 
raised," he says, laugh­
ing. "I would be a doctor 
or a lawyer, some white­
collar guy. I opened the 
World Book Encyclope­
dia when I was 7, it fell 
open to puppets, and I 
said, 'That's what I'll do.' 
It really was that easy." 
Now 43, Burkett is in 
New York, chatting be­
fore an evening perfor­
mance of Street oj Blood. 
Playing at the New York 
Theatre Workshop , it's a 
featured show in the 
prestigious Henson In­
ternational Festival of 
Puppet Theatre. 
Street oj Blood tells 
the sweet and some­
times campy story of 
Esme, an aging Holly­
wood star-turned-vam­
pire; Eden, a gay terror­
ist who blows up bars to 
rile his community; and 
Edna, Eden's mom and a 
self-proclaimed "silly old biddy in a 
Sears housedress." The New York 
Times said Burkett's technical skills in 
bringing to life 14 characters-includ­
ing the Turnip Comers Ladies Orches­
trale, Ute Haagen-Dazs and Jesus-So long, Punch and Judy 
Burkett believes he's the first to include gay 
characters in a text-based puppet show. 
A prime example: Eden Urbane, who's not just 
gay but also a terrorist 
THE ADVOCATE I'" I OCTOBER 24, 2000 simply "astonishes. " 
The show feels so 
personal that-despite 
its fantastic elements­
audiences assume it's 
very autobiographical. 
Burkett is happy to 
leave the question of 
what's real and what 
isn't to their imagina­
tion, but as he does 
make clear, "I will say 
that I've never been 
beaten bloody by my fa­
ther while ·wearing a 
wedding dress." 
You could call Street 
oj Blood Burkett's 
"current" show, but he 
always has so many 
works scheduled for 
performance around 
the world that this 
seems misleading. Str'eet 
oj Blood, for example, 
is part of a trilogy that 
includes Tinka's New 
Dress and Happy (with 
Happy scheduled to 
play throughout Canada 
from November to April 
and in London next 
summer). Also in prepa­
ration are a European 
performance of the 
trilogy; a new work 
tentatively titled The 
Madonna oj Nutter 
Gulch; and a one-man show without 
puppets called The Likes oj Me. 
All of these shows have in common 
gay characters, something Burkett 
thinks was new when he first intro­
duced some in 1986, the year he ~</p>

Young Eden 
(above, right) gets 
into wedding-dress 
drag; Mrs, Edna 
Rural (left), Eden's 
mother, with her 
dog, Dolly 
founded his own company. "To be 
honest with you, I'd never seen any­
one put a character who was gay in a 
text-based puppet show," says Bur­
kett. ''I'm not saying it hasn't been 
done, but I never saw it. Chances are, 
it wasn't done." He pauses, thinking. 
"It just seemed natural. They don't al­
ways have to be happy characters or 
successful characters because I do 
know that there's a prettY emotional ly 
stable big homo [pulling the strings] 
right above them." 
His self-confidence is hard-won: 
Burkett was born and raised in the 
Canadian province of Alberta, in a 
town of 25,000 where people who 
were different paid a price. "I was 
told I was a fag before I even knew 
what that was about," says Burkett. 
"It started early. It was a dirty thing 
people were hostile about. Then you 
figure out what it is and that you actu­
ally are that, and it just becomes 
harder. [But] puppetry really helped 
me because I knew I was getting out." 
Burkett's also getting out of Al­
berta: he's moving from Calgary to 
Toronto. "A ten-year relationship 
has just dissolved this year, and a 
new one has begun, hence the 
move," explains Burkett. "It's been a 
hell of a year." •
