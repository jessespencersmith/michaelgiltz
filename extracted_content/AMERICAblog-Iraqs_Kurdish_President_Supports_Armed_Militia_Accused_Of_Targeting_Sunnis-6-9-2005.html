6/09/2005 10:34:00 AMThings are going swimmingly in Iraq. Two days ago, theKurdish president -- instead of upholding the rule of law andcalling for all armed militias to disband -- threw his supportbehind the Shiite Badr Brigade.President Jalal Talabani's backing of the Badr Brigadecame at a time when Sunni leaders have not onlydemanded that it be disarmed, but have complainedthat the militia provides intelligence and support forsome Shiite-dominated special security units.The Badr Brigade was the military wing of thecountry's largest Shiite political party, the SupremeCouncil of the Islamic Republic in Iraq, or SCIRI. Theparty claims the Badr Brigade is no longer a militia butperforms social and political functions.Yes, the Shiite and Kurdish vision of Iraq doesn't include merely atrained and responsible national army. It apparently also includesarmed ethnic militias, militias that the Sunnis claim are targeting andkilling them. It's more complicated than that, of course. The Kurdsnaturally don't want to give up their militias because they've createdthe one stable, safe area of Iraq and are loathe to put any of that atrisk.For a closer look at Iraq, this diary from the London Review of Booksis insightful. In case you can't access it, here's the depressing kickerby writer Patrick Cockburn:The safest areas in the country, despite the bomb in Arbil,are the three inner Kurdish provinces: Iraq’s 15 otherprovinces are a bloody no man’s land. In the summer heatof the last few weeks, the waters of the Tigris andEuphrates have become warmer. Bodies that were dumpedin the river in the winter months are now rising to thesurface. Hundreds of them are being buried in temporarygraves but nobody knows who they are or why they werekilled.But my favorite part of the USA Today story is the tag at the end thathas become a commonplace. It begins "In other violenceWednesday...."In other violence Wednesday:• Gunmen killed two industry ministry officials in adrive-by shooting in the capital's New Baghdadneighborhood.• One police officer was killed and six injured inclashes between Iraqi police and gunmen in northwestBaghdad after gunmen attacked a police car.• In Mosul, police Col. Nashwan Hadi was killed in adrive-by-shooting near his home. The attackers thenfired a rocket at his house, injuring five people —including two children.• An officer was shot and killed in eastern Mosul.• A car bomb in Baqouba, northeast of Baghdad, killed
