            <p>Illy} Scary 
onsters 
Ralph Lee is perhaps best known by 
New Yorkers for being the guiding 
spirit of the legendarilY eccentric 
Halloween parade in Greenwich Village. 
But as a puppeteer-designer, he spends 
most of his time trying to be in tune with 
the legends, folklore, and myths of others. His latest work, 
Hearl of the farlh: A Popol Vuh Story (at Intar from January 11 to 29) 
is based on a Mayan creation myth. The story of two youths who trav­
el to the underworld and playa deadly game of soccer with the Lords 
ot Death, it was first tackled by Lee in 1980. The latest incarnation 
was one ot the hits of the 1994 International Puppetry Festival at the 
Joseph Papp Public Theater, owing to both the fantastical, wittY crea­
tures (which he based on Mayan imagery) and his charming take on 
the old tale. "There's a lot of pottery put into Mayan graves," explains 
Lee, "and a lot of them depict scenes from the Popol Vuh. The 
Lords of Death are often depicted as decrepit, skeletal 
figures belching great farts, or they'll have some dis­
gusting gases emanating from their mouths. That gave 
me a reallY good clue as to what kind of attitude to 
take: They're humorous and horrific at the same time." 
Growing up in Middlebury, Vermont, Lee used a hand­
puppet theater to tell folk stories at birthday par­
ties and for school groups. An early high point was 
a performance for his father's friend Robert Frost. 
"H wasn't very long, so he was able to endure it," 
Lee says with a laugh. Since then, he's dramatized 
myths and legends from Native American, Eskimo, 
and countless other cul­
tures. "I try to be true 
to the original story, 
but at the same time 
acknowledge that I'm 
Winnebago Indian, for instance."
