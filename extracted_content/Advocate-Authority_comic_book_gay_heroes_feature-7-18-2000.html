= Gay superheroes sneak into the mainstream with 
WildStorm Productions' The Authority By Michael Giltz 
~ 
! Ii n the comic book The Authority, Apollo and Midnighter are typical .J muscle-bound superheroes----quick with a quip and a punishing 
blow. They're also lovers---something that's been made subtly 
clear (via Bert and Ernie jokes, for instance) ever since the comic's 
launch in 1999. Still, fans had to connect the dots for themselves . 
• 
I 
~ Now penned for DC 
Comics imprint WildStorm 
Productions by writer 
Mark Millar and illustrator 
Frank Quitely (both of 
whom are heterosexually 
married with children in 
Scotland), The Authority 
is slowly upping the ante. 
Apollo and Midnighter 
now hug, and they even 
kissed after one nearly 
fatal battle. 
~ Quitely, for one, thinks 
~ the go-slow approach 
C could have unexpected 
~= advantages for educating 
~ the kids reading The Au-
tJwrity. "I'm sure there 
~ were some kids who t thought [Apollo and Mid­
C nighter] were really coo~ " 
C says Quitely, 32. "Then it 
~ started to dawn on them, 
C and they thought, I hope 
• wt; I hope wt. " He SII/IMMI'H$/lIltJW 
The mighty Apollo (left) and 
the black-clad Midnighter cuddle up 
in The Authority. 
• laughs, then adds, "It's good for them to deal with." 
t Now those fans are dealing with a lot more. In an recent issue the 
~~ bad guys made references to Richard Gere and Tom Cruise while 
pummeling Apollo. The superhero is seen slumped facedown over 
the hood of a car, his tight-fitting costume ripped and torn. Then one 
C evil character, Commander, approaches Apollo for what will be, it 
~ seems, a sexual assault. That's something Batman and Superman 
• certainly never had to fend off. 
"Originally I drew Commander undoing his belt buckle and then 
• doing it up again afterward," says Quitely. "But DC changed it to 
• where Commander's just putting his thumbs inside his belt." 
~. Readers still got the idea "Mark goes online after every issue comes 
out," says Quitely. "AnQ they were all saying they couldn't wait to see 
what Midnighter would do to the bad guys for messing with his man. " •
