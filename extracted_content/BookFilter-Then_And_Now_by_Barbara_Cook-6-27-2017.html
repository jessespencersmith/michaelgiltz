From the Publisher: One of the greatest American singers and actresses of
her generation looks back on a magical and turbulent life spanning a halfcentury of theatrical history from the golden age of the Broadway musicalto the present day. A legend of the American theater, Barbara Cook burst
upon the scene to become Broadway’s leading ingénue in roles such as
Cunégonde in Leonard Bernstein’s Candide , Amalia Balash in Jerry Bock’s
She Loves Me , and her career-defining, Tony-winning role as the original
Marian the librarian in Meredith Willson’s The Music Man.  But in the late
1960s, Barbara’s extraordinary talent onstage was threatened bydebilitating depression and alcoholism that forced her to step away fromthe limelight and out of the public life. Emerging from the shadows in theearly 1970s, Barbara reinvented herself as the country’s leading concert…

What We Say
One of the greats, with the Tony and Kennedy Center Honors to show for it, Barbara Cook is a peerless interpreter of classic
tunes from Rodgers and Hammerstein to Stephen Sondheim. Though effortlessly commanding on stage, Cook had a difficultlife, from abandonment by her beloved father to the controlling neediness of her probably unstable mother to alcoholism
that plagued both Cook and her marvelous accompanist, Wally Harper. She bares all in this memoir. Ardent fans will surely
savor the passages about that famously challenging aria from "Candide" and her prickly friendship with Elaine Stritch. Cookis forthright, but always hardest on herself. A "natural" singer who has studied and honed her craft to perfection, Cook isShare This Book

<p>far from a natural raconteur, a la Stritch. Her memoir is baldly descriptive, often flat and honestly a bit of a slog for any
but the most devoted of fans, myself among them. It's welcome as a hint to the complicated, challenging life she led. Her
honesty is admirable. But Cook's soul remains bared most beautifully on stage, in song. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
“Then and Now  is narrated with the same homey bonhomie that has informed Ms. Cook’s stage patter in recent
years.” - New York Times
“Theater rats will savor Ms. Cook’s account of her ‘Candide’ audition in front of the show’s composer, Leonard
Bernstein . . . It’s clear in every word she sings that her wisdom is deep and hard-won.” - Wall Street Journal
“It’s all here in Cook’s memoir. Great theater, great people, not so great people, alcoholism, compulsive eating,
an affair with actor Arthur Hill when they were both married to other people; the great love of the lady’s life. A
second career in cabaret that continues into her ninth decade.” - WOSU/NPR News and Classical Music
“And what a story it is, told in a bright, refreshing and brutally honest voice, in a manner that you would expect
from Barbara Cook…. Get yourself a copy of Then & Now  now and plunge into it, giving yourself breaks here and
there to listen to Barbara singing…” - Huffington Post
