4/18/2005 03:07:00 PMA number of people have scoffed at paying attention to theconclave -- who cares, religion is a farce, the Catholic Church isblah blah blah. Well, it does matter. Whatever you think ofChina or WalMart or numerous other countries andtransnational institutions, they have a huge impact on manypeople's lives. Paying attention to the direction they're headingin and who is leading them is important.Maybe -- like me -- you thought the former Soviet Union reallywas an evil empire. Or maybe you thought it was no better orworse than the U.S. But its leader mattered. Mikhail Gorbachevis a far different ruler than Josef Stalin.So, yes, it does matter who becomes the next bishop of Rome.So far, day one and the smoke is black, meaning no new pope.Remember, JP II instituted the nuclear option ahead of BillFrist, so the longer it drags on (10 plus days), the more likelywe are to have a divisive candidate who couldn't muster thesupport of the super-majority (2/3rds plus one) that used to bethe benchmark for a pontiff.
