6/22/2005 12:47:00 PMI've been playing a little game for the past few months with theScience section of the New York Times. I've often wonderedwhat it was like for creationists -- their anti-science bias is sostrong that they can barely go a day without being assaultedon TV, in movies and in the newspaper by facts and ideas thatundercut everything they believe. So I've tried to get throughthe Science section each week without stumbling acrosssomething that would send them into a frenzy of denial andlies. It isn't possible. This week, the very first story was on theamazing complexity of jellyfish, which included the passingthought that it had inspired new ideas about "how animalsevolved 600 million years ago." Oops. There goes that "theearth is 6000 years old" argument.Many weeks, almost every story in the section will includesome scientific fact that makes a mockery of the arguments ofun-intelligent design. Quite simply, it's impossible to stay ontop of the latest scientific news without realizing creationism isboth hogwash and undercut by almost every area of scienceyou can name. Try and read the science section of your localpaper without being tripped up by "facts" and see how far youget.
