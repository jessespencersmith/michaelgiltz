BookFilter: Karin Slaughter's Back, Battling Kellogg Brothers & Why Buddhism Is True</p>
<p>THE GOOD DAUGHTER by Karin Slaughter
Karin Slaughter was one of our favorite writers even before  she graciously agreed to be the first author profiled  
at BookFilter! Since then she's just become more and more popular around the world, selling tens of millions 
of books in all. The Good Daughter  is her latest stand-alone and might just be the one to give Slaughter her 
latest goal: a #1 New York Times bestseller. We just got our copy so by the time you read this newsletter, we will be bleary eyed and happy after staying up half the night....  Read More.

THE KELLOGGS by Howard Markel  
Health advocate Dr. John Harvey Kellogg was such a...colorful character in American history (lampooned in T. Coraghessan Boyle's "The Road To Wellville") that it's forgivable for author Howard Markel to be a bit on the</p>
<p>sober side when telling the story of the Kellogg brothers. John was a stupendously famous advocate of 
exercise, a vegetarian diet, and what we would call health food. His brother Will served in John's shadow and made that man's empire hum...until going off on his own (after 25 years!) to found the hugely profitable Kellogg cereal company. Both did admirable charity work, both lacked a happy private life and both were embittered with one another almost their entire adult lives.  .... Read More.

FAREWELL, EUSTACE TILLY!    The brilliant writer E.B. White  was a mainstay at The New Yorker for 
decades. Typically, he announced his departure as a staff writer in droll style: posing as the magazine's iconic
 
cover model Eustace Tilly, White bid a fond farewell on August 7, 1937, exactly 80 years ago this week. If it's 
been a while and you don't mind a good cry read Charlotte's Web  again.

THE LOCALS by Jonathan Dee  
In his wise and wonderful novel, Pulitzer Prize finalist Jonathan Dee writes about a Berkshires community struggling to keep up a middle class standard of life. The novel opens in 2001, right after 9/11 when the small town of Howland, Massachusetts is still reeling emotionally and economically from the attack and the recession of previous years. Enter hedge fund billionaire Philip Hadi. Fearing another 9/11, Hadi has flipped from a summer resident to a full-time member of the community and now he's even willing to take on the role of First Selectman (mayor, to you urbanites). Does he really want to help the people of Howland or does he just want to keep the town and its services running smoothly for his own personal comfort? Does it matter? This book is a literary dissection of our entire country.... Read More.</p>

THE BOOK OF EMMA REYES by Emma Reyes   
Why are we so fascinated by stories of brutal, difficult or just plain desperately poor childhoods? Think 
Angela's Ashes  or The Glass Castle  or a million other titles. Many reasons, perhaps, but when they're written 
so well as this, perhaps it doesn't matter. The Colombian artist Reyes was indeed desperately poor as a child and then escaped (!) a life in a convent at 19 years old. Her memoir in letters was discovered after she died and has become a critically acclaimed sensation in Latin America.... Read More.

<p>THE DRIVER by Hart Hanson  
If you're a fan of the TV show Bones , this is the first thriller by the creator behind it. Hart Hanson (which 
sounds like the name of a spy or tough-guy detective, come to think of it) crafted this movie-ready tale about 
an Army vet with a limo service who saves the life of teenaged skate boarding mogul and then must keep the kid safe while they figure out who's trying to kill him. Then it gets really interesting.... Read More.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY PHILIP LARKIN  
Happy Birthday to Philip Larkin,  perhaps England's (if not the world's!) greatest poet-librarian. He was born 
on August 9, 1922, had a look around, sighed  and said, "This just won't do." Some recent bios have tried to 
rehabilitate his image -- yes, he was racist, but you know, not that  racist. Oddly, the most recent book about 
him focuses on his photography.  The famously dour poet is ironically remembered by many for the sweet 
lines,  "Our almost-instinct, almost true:   What will survive of us is love."  The Beatles said it better (and even 
rhymed):    "And in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make."    But Larkin  wasn't being quite so 
sentimental. Note that he said it's almost  true.

WHY BUDDHISM IS TRUE by Robert Wright  
Journalist Robert Wright has produced a string of lucid, best-selling books about history and science (especially the burgeoning field of evolutionary psychology) when not co-founding the site Bloggingheads.tv. Now he's turned his sights on buddhism. A self-described hothead, Wright says he's the last person one</p>
<p>could imagine mediating quietly and thus of course the very sort of person who might benefit the most from 
doing just that. Wright is amusing and straight-forward, presenting a very secular, Western (and yet valid) take  
on Buddhism as self-help or at least a practice that he says you would benefit from. Anyone vaguely interested in the topic or suspecting that all this talk of mindfulness has its roots in Buddhism can safely dip their toes in the water here.... Read More.

LITTLE RED RIDING SHEEP by Linda Ravin Lodding  
Some picture books seem just fine...until you them with a kid and suddenly you're both giggling a lot. This playful retelling if Little Red Riding Hood stars a sheep named Arnold who has a lot of suggestions, like making the woods less scary and casting his warthog friend Frankie as the Granny and well, you get the idea. Words by Linda Ravin Lodding and illustrations by Cale Atkinson, who doesn't even seem to mind when the sheep calls in his painter friend Luigi to give him some touch-ups at a crucial moment....
