If you have adventurous ears and like music from all sorts of genres, keep checking in. This week, I've got
a gem from Ron Sexsmith,  which is redundant at this stage. His albums come in two flavors: good and
very good. His new CD -- Long Player Late Bloomer  -- is very good.

<p>Like Richard Thompson and other perennial favorites of critics and fellow musicians, every album or so
by Ron Sexsmith  is touted as "the one" -- the album that's going to break him out and finally get
Sexsmith the commercial rewards he so richly deserves. I'd love to think so, but don't you believe it.
Chances are, if you're smart and daring enough to lay some money down on a CD by a man who crafts
brilliant pop music for adults, Ron Sexsmith will become a new favorite of yours AND a well-kept secret
you can feel special for sharing with the likes of Sheryl Crow, John Hiatt, Elvis Costello, kd lang andmore rock music writers than you can shake a stick at. On the plus side, this means you can continue tosee Sexsmith perform in venues around the country where intimacy rather than spectacle is thewatchword and -- hopefully -- where fans are there to hear him perform, rather than just there to be seenand heard by everyone around them.
But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the planets are aligning to give him the audience he deserves. A
documentary film about him just debuted on TV in the UK. Love Shines  -- also a track on his new album -
- will play at the SXSW event this month. The acclaim for his new CD is certainly deafening. And withmost of his albums, the more I listen to it the more it sinks into my brain and won't let go.
Sexsmith has a McCartney-esque gift for melody, but they're not the sort of hooks that grab you by the
throat. They're sneaky, slithery things that slide into your subconsciousness -- always hummable, alwaysmemorable but in a very low-key manner. First you listen, then you sing along, then you start hearing themelodies in your head all the time. By the fourth or fifth listen to Long Player Late Bloomer,  you'll swear
you've known these songs all your life.
You can stream all the new songs on MySpace right now.
For Sexsmith, it's also quite a forceful album. His voice always brings a melancholy air, a blue-ish tinge to
all he sings. But here the arrangements practically rock out, especially for an act whose mellowness is oneof his chief attributes.
"Get In Line" is an amusing opener about everyone trying to bring him down or explain to Sexsmith what
he's doing wrong in his career. Heaven? Peace and love? He'll "Believe It When I See It." "Middle OfLove" is probably the key radio track -- the song that seems like the winner that can finally get himplayed on the air. And the title tune is his forceful statement of purpose -- he's not driven by the need forcommercial success, but it sure would be nice. Sexsmith isn't depressed by having more clippings thanalbum sales and he doesn't feel beaten yet. If anything, he's coming into his own. "I'm a late bloomer/ I'ma slow learner/ And I've heard the penny drop/ I'm a small player/ With a tall order/ To come out ontop."
As I've said, this is pop music for adults. Some people write songs about passionate first love, wild-eyed
romance. Sexsmith delivers the even more romantic sound of someone who appreciates more and morewhat they have every day. Some pop songs are for wooing on a first date. Sexsmith's tunes will break yourlover's heart with their beauty on your anniversary. On "Miracles," he sings, "It's a miracle/ Here in thishand I hold/ Here in this band of gold/ How even the silence/ Seems to say more than enough." A songabout a happy marriage? Now that's romantic.
His list of great albums is long and growing, from the notable breakthrough Ron Sexsmith  -- touted
loudly and widely by Elvis Costello -- to peaks like Whereabouts  and Retriever  to the one-off
collaboration with drummer Don Kerr, Destination Unknown . I've been obsessed at times with tunes like

<p>"Gold In Them Hills" and "Snow Angels" and his holiday tune "Maybe This Christmas" is always part of
my December music mix. Simply trying to decide who to compare him to let's you know the depth of histalent. An American Prefab Sprout? A happier Elliott Smith? A Paul McCartney who bizarrely can't scorehits? A less quirky Joni Mitchell? Here's Elvis Costello weighing in with high praise indeed.
Here's Sexsmith dueting with Chris Martin of Coldplay on "Gold In Them Hills."
And hey, why not buy Long Player Late Bloomer  and turn it into the unlikeliest/likeliest hit of the year?
I'd love to be proven wrong.
