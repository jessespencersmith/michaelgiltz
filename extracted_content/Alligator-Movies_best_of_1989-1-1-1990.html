            <p>The APPLA USETop Ten * 
(from the reviews of MICHAEL GlLTZ 
Do The Ript Thing -
Spike Lee's extremely 
funny and entertaining 
look at a New York City 
neighborhood on the hot­
test day of the year. Sadly 
prophetic about racial 
tensions, the power· of 
this movie is that people 
of every race can leave the 
theater with a better un­
derstanding of how-the d STEPHEN NIX) r 
other person feels. A truly great film and easily Lee's 
best to date. 
sex, lies, .. "d fJideot"pe -As unconventional as its 
title, this intriguing look at intercourse between four 
young adults offers both a singular view of troubled 
lives and brilliant glimpses at our own behavior. 
Consisting entirely of conversations and confronta­
tions set against the simplesi: of set pieces, the film 
uses remarkably lean but provocative dialogue to 
reveal an exercise in economy that's simply profound. 
Born on the Fourth of July -Oliver Stone's return 
to Vietnam takes place mainly in North America, 
following 12 years in the life of an American marine. 
Like no film before it, this exhaustive character study 
confronts the issue of troubled veterans and their place 
in post-war America, and boasts an outstanding pro­
duction, stunning visuals and genuine acting from its 
star, Tom Cruise. 
Heathers -Perhaps the only high school black 
comedy, this wicked look at cliques and politics grows 
as increasingly dark as it does hilarious. Fronted by 
Christian Slater's impression of a young Jack Nichol­
son, the film offers great work from a nearly unknown 
cast and a stunning new look for co-lead Winona 
Ryder. Inventive, intriguing and far off-beat, this is by 
far the year's best comedy. 
Crimes and Misdemeanors -Woody Allen may well 
be the only talent that can take a light look at love 
laced with great comic moments and balance it per­
fectly against a completely unrelated, tightly focused 
tale of blackmail, guilt and murder. His result is 
unique, and is highlighted by gripping visuals, terrific 
performances and a brief but hilarious film-within-a­
film.</p>

on-their-Iuck brothers who hire a amger to spice up 
their lounge act is downbeat" jazzy and, above ~

D",gstore Codor -Co Van Sant's ~ poetic 
depiction of drug addicts who c:ndee from druptore

Dillon is marvelous as aD addict who "'Iibe the life­
style" but decides UviDg 011 the lam im't worth it. 
SCI"lIltd -Based 011 the true story of a poUtical sex 
scandal in the '60s, this British drama carefully dissects 
the class system in Bngland and the people who try to 
break through it. John Hurt is paiDful and precise as 
the socially climbing doctor who becomes a scape-goat 
for the government. 
The Littk Mn."udtl -Disney dismantles the age 
barrier with its latest full-length animated feature -
a phenomenal achievement in Sight, sound and story. .
