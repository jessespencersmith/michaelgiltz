Equine-imity ARTIST VALERIE SHAFF is lying on her back while we talk. 
"I just came back from the barn and from yoga;' she laughs. 
"And I'm just getting over a bOllt with Lyme disease. It's been 
very challenging." Photographer Valerie Shaff captures 
the dignity and personality of the horse. Based in upstate New York's Germantown, Shaff has worked 
in every possible way as a photographer: she's done everything 
from wedding photography to advertising, celebrity portraits 
for national magazines, and private commissions. By Michael Giltz

Shaff is probably best known for her witty, respectful focus 
on animals, which led to a series of best-selling books with hu­
morist Roy Blunt Jr. that include If Only You Knew How Much I 
Smell You: True Portraits of Dogs to Am I Pig Enough for You Yet: 
Voices of the Barnyard. 
Currently, amidst all her professional obligations, Shaff do­
nates time to Puppies Behind Bars, an organization that brings 
prisoners and puppies together so that the puppies can be so­
cialized and trained and, ultimately, work as service dogs and 
seeing-eye dogs for the blind. That volunteer work led Shaff to a 
current project where she does portraits of prisoners who have 
successfully transition ed back into society. 
Still, from that first Kodak camera Shaff received when she 
was 8 years old to today, one constant has been her fascination 
with and love of horses. 
"I wasn't the horsiest of little girls;' recalls Shaff, who is 50. 
"There was always a group of girls who were referred to as 'the 
horses' and they galloped around at recess and had long pony­
tails. I was not a 'horse,' per se, but I always certainly loved hors­
es. I grew up in Hastings-on-Hudso n, which is suburban, 
though pretty, so there weren't a lot of horses there. So whenev­
er we went on vacation and any horse we crossed paths with, I 
had to shoot them." 
Perhaps one reason Shaff finds horses so fascinating to pho-tograph is the difficulty it presents. 
"Horses are so challenging;' states Shaff. "What I'm interest­
ed in when I photograph animals-besides wanting to make 
something that's formally beautiful-I like to monument alize 
the specific animal and really capture its personality. You can 
manipulate dogs in many ways, for example; they're very re­
sponsive to people. Whereas horses are by and large not nearly 
as interested in people as dogs are. To get them to do something 
you want them to do-when you're not on their back-is very 
difficult:' 
Off course, getting horses to do what you want even when 
you're on their back isn't always so simple either! 
"I ride at a wonderful, wonderful equestrian center called 
Southlands Foundation ;' Shaff describes. "It was established by 
a woman named Deborah Dows. When the family estate was 
being divided up, she asked for the south lands and created this 
equestrian center. The people who teach there were her original 
students. It's a beautiful land concern as well as being an eques­
trian center. 
''I'm not such an equestrian that no matter where I live I 
would make a point of riding, but I ride here because South­
lands exists. It's such a beautiful place, and the horses are so 
well-treated. We probably have some of the best school horses 
that any barn has ever had."
