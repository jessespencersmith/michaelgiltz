            <p>THE STATE OF 
GAYS IN THE MILITARY 
A SPECIAL ADVOCATE REPORT 
The battle of . 
Britain 
Mter years of fighting the U.K.'s ban on 
gay soldiers, British activists celebrate 
its sudden elimination BY MICHAEL GILTZ 
Simon Langley was at a BBC 
television studio in London 
one day last September when 
the European Court of 
Human Rights delivered a 
death blow to the United Kingdom's ban 
on gays and lesbians in the military. The 
vice chairman of Rank Outsiders, the 
British equivalent of the Servicemembers 
Legal Defense Network, Langley was at 
the station to give interviews about the 
impending ruling, not knowing whether it 
would be a triumph or a setback 
"When the fax came through with the 
decision from the comt, " Langley remem­
bers, "it was a feeling of pure elation." 
The court decision, which held that 
the ban violated the rights of gay and les­
bian personnel, led Defense Minister Ge­
offrey Hoon to order new guidelines that 
allow lesbians and gays to serve openly 
in the military. The move made the Unit­
ed Kingdom the latest addition to a long list of countries, including Australia and 
Israel, that do so, even as the United 
States still grapples with the issue. 
Langley had signed up with the navy 
at 18, knowing he was gay but being so 
gung ho to serve that giving up a private 
life seemed a small price to pay. "The 
way I'd stop it from being an issue was 
that I'd basically be celibate," he says. "I 
said I'd cope with it, but in fact I couldn't. 
After about six years I realized I had my 
own emotional needs, and I wasn't able 
to satisfy them." 
Langley reluctantly resigned from the 
navy in 1993 and joined Rank Outsiders. 
He ticks off the group's accomplish­
ments, including getting chaplains and 
doctors to provide confidentiality to 
people who seek advice from them. 
Of course, the battle is far from over 
for Rank Outsiders. "We've always been 
careful to focus on the one goal of end­
ing the ban," says Langley. "But now 
THE ADVOCATE 1311 APRIL 25, 2000 that it's happened, it raises all sorts of 
other issues: pensions , housing for part­
ners, and so on. We've got a lot more 
work to do." 
Still, it is a major triumph, one that 
Duncan Lustig-Prean, a former navy 
lieutenant commander, savors. As one 
of the four plaintiffs in the lawsuit 
brought before the European Court of 
Human Rights, Lustig-Prean has been 
consumed for five years with the case. 
The exhaustion shows, though his 
military bearing and appearance (he 
still has the buzz cut of a man in uni­
form) belie the toll the case has taken 
on him. "I'm glad it's over," he admits, 
sitting comfortably in his apartment 
near two photos: one of his great-grand­
father, a general, and another of himself 
in uniform standing with his partner. 
Lustig-Prean's journey has been filled 
with contrasts. A gay man, he compiled 
the brief that first urged the military to 
recruit women. An officer from the 
upper class, Lustig-Prean now lives in 
Tottenham , one of the poorest London 
suburbs. A great respecter of military 
tradition, he has also emphasized a cer­
tain eccentricity-even greeting the 
men who served under him with a 
cheery "Hello, girls!" every morning. 
The day Lustig-Prean left the military, 
he told his men why. He took comfort 
in one officer's reaction. "He pointed at 
a picture of me greeting the queen and 
said, 'I always thought there was more 
than one queen in that photo.''' 
A high-profile spokesman for ending 
the ban, Lustig-Prean says he's received 
almost no hate letters but later allows 
that he did once receive a bullet in the 
mail. He too was at the BBC the day the 
court ruling was announced. Lustig­
Prean was giving interviews till 1 in the 
morning but did make sure he took care 
of one bit of personal business. 
"My main thing was my parents," he 
says. "I wanted to tell them the results 
before they heard it on the news." One 
press report he loathed described them 
as dripping with champagne by the end 
of the evening, but the truth is, "I 
haven't actually gone out to celebrate 
yet. I've been too busy." •
