8/13/2004 01:37:00 AMThe Bush people continue to dribble out information to try and justifythat raised terror alert/campaign stop led by Tom Ridge. Every timethey offer up another tidbit, I can't help thinking, "Stop!" Todaythey're saying/repeating that the surveillance files were "updated" asrecently as spring. I put "updated" in quotes not to be sarcastic butbecause it could mean as little as the fact that the files were opened,something that has been reported previously.But what about that leak of the Al Quaeda turncoat? Condi Rice saidthe Bushies just gave it to the mean ole reporters on background.Tom Ridge said he doesn't know who leaked out. But now the WhiteHouse is claiming vaguely that"it appeared Mr. Khan's name had been first disclosed by officialsoverseas, not in the United States. In any event, the [White House]official said, the arrest of terror suspects, even when unannounced, isoften quickly detected by their families and associates. Americanofficials have denied news accounts that Mr. Khan was working as amole, or an informant for Pakistan, when he was arrested."In other words, the White House said: it wasn't us, it was someoneelse; what's the big deal of announcing an arrest in the press sinceeveryone would know about it anyway; and he wasn't really a mole."Wow, that's a lot of backtracking.
