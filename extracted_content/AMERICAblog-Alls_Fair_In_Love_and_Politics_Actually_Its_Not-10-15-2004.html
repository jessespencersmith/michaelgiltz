10/15/2004 03:40:00 AMPaul Krugman does a nice roundup about some of the Republicandirty tricks to disenfranchise voters. Of course, these are just theones we know about. He also previews an upcoming Harper's articleabout those Florida felon lists."The case of Florida's felon list - used by state officials, as in 2000, totry to wrongly disenfranchise thousands of blacks - has been widelyreported. Less widely reported has been overwhelming evidence thatthe errors were deliberate."In an article coming next week in Harper's, Greg Palast, whooriginally reported the story of the 2000 felon list, reveals that few ofthose wrongly purged from the voting rolls in 2000 are back on thevoter lists. State officials have imposed Kafkaesque hurdles for voterstrying to get back on the rolls. Depending on the county, thoseattempting to get their votes back have been required to seekclemency for crimes committed by others, or to go through quasi-judicial proceedings to prove that they are not felons with similarnames."For heaven's sake, deluge your favorite media outlet and ask them tolook into this pattern of deception and report on it. Anyone with infoabout Democratic organizations doing anything even remotely similar,bring it on. We'll gladly blast them too. But guess what? The historyof the Democratic Party is trying to HELP people vote (women,blacks, immigrants), not KEEPING them from voting the way theRepublicans have always done.
