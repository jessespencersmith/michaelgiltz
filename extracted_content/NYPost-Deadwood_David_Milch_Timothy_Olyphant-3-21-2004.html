• REALLY BIG SHOW 
Cowboys, Sopranos-style 
By MICHAEL GILTZ 
IF '00 were wondering how HDO was 
going to gel a big bang now that "Sex 
and the City,· has put the Manolos 
away and "The Sopranos" is eyeing the 
I1nish line. think ODe word: "Deadwood." 
A Western sffrin lheDal<otas during the 
18705. "Deadwood" re1magines the TV 
western a a bloody, dusry, ioul-mouthed 
u<iiverse . There's no Matt Dillon or Miss 
Kitty. The cowboys curse, lhe whores are 
. nliSty and th~ series' violence would 
make ~"en Tony Soprllno flinch. In the 
rradition of the HBO prison show, "Ox .. 
"Deadwood" also has male frontal nudit).. 
One of t~e besr ~hings about lttis gritty 
drama IS us sterling Ca5t: Keilh Carra· 
dine, Powers Boorhe, Brad Dourif. Ricky 
Jay, Molly Parker and B terrific lead in 
Timothy Olyphant. 
The creative force behind the show is 
DliVid Milch. co-crealor of "HID Streel 
Blues," who immcr3ed himself in period 
Research, which accounts for [he series' 
coarse lan~age. Atcording to 1\1llch, it's 
all aurbennc and essential. 
"The languag~ seemed to me so much 
of the essence of thai world," says Milch. 
"/ spent an awful lot of lime al the Living 
Memory Projecl at the library of Con­
gress. There wasn't anybody who writes 
ab, ur tbat setdemenr who doesn't say 
you just couldn't bear to listen 10 -people 
talk -the unrelieved Ob5Cenlty imposed 
irself so strikingly On everybody." The cursing is so constant thai it threat­
ens to overshad ow the fact that Milch has 
created a gripping drama. While Milch is 
aware that "historically accurate" can be 
boring, he's marlaged to populate this 
town with I1gures ',,,ho lived at the time 
-great, familiar characters such as Wild 
Bill Hickok (a magnetic Carradine) and 
Calamity Jane (Robin Weigert). 
Milch's Old West doesn't include Indi­
ans at first. "Two weeks berol'e [h~ fse­
ries) begin ," M.llluins Milch, "CU3tcr had 
his batt I. alllnie Big Hnm. In the after­
math, Crarl' Horse wem west and Strtin2

member see ins: John Wayne crying." Olyphant was the first actor cast in the 
series and, after years of knocking about 
about in Hollywood in search of a career 
(his I11ms include "Scream II"), he's 
clearly found the role of a lifetime. 
,,( commJued 10 tbis he~llU3e oi ju tone

Well. this time, Olyphanl didn't have to 
gel in line behind the Pitt;, Damons and 
Depps of the worid. "I didn't know Timo­
thy at all," savs Milch. ~h(] adds that, to­

the gunman from a \"igilante figure of jus·

"an active conscien ce." 
"Bullock is the apostolic successor to 
the gunfighter," says Milch. "He was a 
more responsible figure."
