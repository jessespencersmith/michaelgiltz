            <p>F R I D AY,  J A N U A RY  1 9 ,  2 0 0 7"30 Rock" Almost Certain To Get Second SeasonAt the annual TV convention, NBC's head gave every indication that"30 Rock" would return for a second season. His enthusiasm for"Friday Night Lights" was somewhat similar though not as strong. Nowif only he could realize "FNL" is a spring-only series that should run onFriday nights without reruns. (Also, "Everybody Hates Chris" has beenofficially renewed.)At the same convention, Aaron Sorkin talked about "Studio 60 On theSunset Strip" in an attempt to show he understand the criticisms of theshow. Unfortunately, he was so defensive and unintentionallyobnoxious, it's clear he DOESN'T understand. “I get it when peoplewrite that there’s a smugness to the show, there’s an arrogance to theshow,” [Sorkin] said.“I get it when people write that the characters on the show takedoing the television show too seriously.... “Doing a TV show issomething I take seriously, and it’s something everybody heretakes very seriously. But it’s something that the average personwho, for lack of a better word, works a real job, resents slightlybecause it doesn’t seem like a real job.”Uh, no. People don't resent the fact that TV people have a fun,high-paying job doing something that should be a blast. They think it'scool and interesting. But people doing "real" jobs don't take their ownjobs so seriously. Whether they're UPS drivers or store clerks oraccountants or bankers or whatever, they may take pride in their workbut they don't act as if the fate of the free world hangs in the balance.Heck, Buffy the Vampire Slayer actually DOES save the world and evenshe doesn't take her job that seriously. People don't RESENT Sorkinbecause he's got a fun job. They just don't understand why he doesn'ttake the stick out of his butt. It's a frickin' variety show. You can takeyour job seriously, yearn to do it well, work really hard and STILL havefun doing it. But not apparently if you're Sorkin. Clearly, he doesn't getit. Not in the least.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT 12:48 PM
