            <p>~~~~~~~!rl Island at War 
Stage Beauty ** Billy Crudup is one of the 
most frustrating talents 
working today. He is incan­
descent on stage, but when it 
comes to movies, he is some­
how opaque. Despite one 
memorable scene in which he 
auditions for the king, the 
same is true here in this peri­
od drama. But there's no puz­
zle this time: Crudup is hap­
lessly miscast as a cross­
dressing performer. He is 
never convincing as a 
woman, much less "the most 
beautiful woman on the 
London stage." Minor extras 
include a commentary by 
director Richard Eyre. 
21 Jump Street: 
Second Season **1/2 Johnny Depp can't seem to go 
through an interview without 
trashing "21 Jump Street" 
(Anchor Bay; $44.98), the silly 
yet harmless drama about 
cops going undercover at a 
high school. He should be 
kinder to the show that turned 
him into a star and gave early 
breaks to Jason Priestley, Brad 
Pitt and others. Other star­
making series just out: 
"Felicity Senior Year" 
(Touchstone; $59.99) and 
"Xena: The'Final Season" 
(Anchor Bay; $79.98). 
Piccadilly *** Louise Brooks. Josephine 
Baker. And now Anna May 
Wong. Yes, sex always sells 
and the sirens of yesteryear 
are ripe for rediscovery. 
Wong is the latest, with her **** If I'OU missed this recent 
"Masterpiece Theatre" 
miniseries about a 
British island in the 
English Channel under 
Nazi occupation during 
WWII, now's your 
chance. A complex, 
entertaining drama 
(Acorn; $59.99), it's 
unquestionably going to 
be remembered as one 
of -if not the best­
miniseries of the year. 
Other top-notch TV just 
out: "SCTV Volume 3" 
(Shout; $89.98) and 
"Popular Second 
Season" (Touchstone; 
$59.99). 
turn as scullery maid turned 
overnight sensation in 1929's 
"Piccadilly" (Image; $29.99). 
Fine extras include many 
stills, the original British 
press kit from 1929, a mini­
documentary on the score 
and a panel discussion on 
Wong led by B. Ruby Rich. 
Ladder 49 
* Firefighting is inherently cin-
ematic and stirring. So why 
hasn't there ever been a great 
movie about firefighters? 
That sad trend continues 
with "Ladder 49" 
(Touchstone; $29.99), an 
almost woefully by-the-num­
bers drama about a new rook­
ie (Joaquin Phoenix) who 
joins his band of brothers. 
Playful hazing, a fallen com­
rade, a wedding and a sad but 
heroic finale: It's all dutifully 
here. Extras include a com­
mentary track and -best of 
all -real stories by real fire­
fighters. 89
