Here are some of the best from the first batch of ads:I'M A CYBORG, BUT THAT'S OK(Actually, this will come to the US since it's by the director of"Oldboy.")GRAMERA THE BRAVE"The Never Changing Hero! Our Gramera!"(picture a giant turtle for this Japanese entry)18 MINUTES"Those who have loved or are loved will not walk in darkness." -- Plato(Surely it's the only movie in history to use a quote from Plato as itstagline. But is it Plato? Sure doesn't sound like him and it does echocertain Biblical passages. Did they use an actual quote from Plato orjust make it up?)ISABELLA"Is she a one-nighter or is she his daughter?"The most explanatory tagline:TYPHOON 101"Four supernaturally powered young men must fight to save the city ofTapei from disappearing forever in a devastating typhoon summonedby a vengeful demon."And the most unnecessary:THE LONGEST NIGHT IN SHANGHAI"A romantic love story set in the bustle of a large Asian city, namelyShanghai."Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
