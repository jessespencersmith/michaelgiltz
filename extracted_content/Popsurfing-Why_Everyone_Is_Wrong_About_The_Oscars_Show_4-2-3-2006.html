            <p>Newer PostOlder PostF R I D AY,  F E B R U A RY  0 3 ,  2 0 0 6Why Everyone Is Wrong About The Oscars Show#4The final myth: audiences will be turned off because BrokebackMountain is controversial. First of all, Brokeback Mountain isn'tcontroversial. As story after story has shown, Brokeback is playing inthe heartland just as well as it's playing on the coasts. Reviews havebeen unanimously strong, the far right hasn't staged anydemonstrations or boycotts to protest it or even condemned the moviestrongly, and teenage girls (and some teenage boys) are lining up to seeit again and again. The movie has grossed $50 million, opens wide thisweekend and will probably gross $90 to $100 million when all is saidand done. That's a blockbuster for a quiet drama like this. By everystandard, Brokeback is a landmark film embraced by audiences aroundthe country -- and increasingly around the world. And why exactlywould controversy keep people from watching the Oscars? What willJake or Heath say if they win? And will the gay cowboy movie win BestPicture? If I were one of the producers, I'd be thrilled it's a frontrunner.There's a huge curiosity factor and that's why Oscar has nothing toworry about.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
