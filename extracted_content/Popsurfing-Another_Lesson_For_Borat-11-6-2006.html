            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  N O V E M B E R  0 6 ,  2 0 0 6Another Lesson For "Borat"Some other studios claim Fox left money on the table by having "Borat"debut on only 837 screens. If it had been on 3000 screens, maybe itcould have doubled the $26 million it made...or done even better.Here's another thought: maybe studios are wasting money by openingevery stupid movie on 3000 screens. If you can make $26 mil on just800 screens, why do you need 3000 screen openings for anything but"Spiderman 3? Until digital projectors become common, every singleprint you make costs lots of money. Plus, there's a lot to be said forpacked houses roaring with laughter over a comedy. If the movie hadmade $40 million but the theaters weren't nearly as full (and thepeople in them weren't so excited to be seeing a sold-out film), maybethe experience wouldn't have been so much fun and the word of mouthnot so electric as it's going to be. See "Borat" three weeks from now in atwo-thirds empty theater on a Wednesday afternoon and trust me,you'll come out saying, "It was alright, but it wasn't that funny.' Go on aFriday night in primetime and you'll enjoy it a lot more. Instead ofthinking Fox wasted money by not being on more screens, maybe everyother studio is WASTING money by going beyond 1500 screens andgiving moviegoers a less-satisfying experience in the process.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
