THEATER: Another "Christmas Carol," God Bless
'em
A  CHRISTMAS  CAROL  ** out of ****
LYCEUM  THEATRE
Who wants to be a Scrooge when reviewing A  Christmas  Carol  in any
form? Not me, hence the generous two stars and a shout outs to some
of the pluses in this holiday production imported (much like ourmodern conception of Christmas) from Merrie Olde England. It's awarm, inviting stage on display, with lots of lamps casting a cheerful
glow, the cast appropriately garbed (by and large) and some Christmas
snow (that's not a spoiler; you know there's going to be snow) that'squick melting and fun rather than boring confetti.
Campbell Scott is a fine Scrooge that can hold his head high next to his
dad's solid work in the same story. He harrumphs and galumphs andmelts just as quickly as that snow. But it's a real performance, not apanto bit of fun winking at the audience and not too hard-edgedeither. Indeed, Scott has a twinkle when dismissing his nephew early
on that hints at an even fuller characterization he might tackle
someday in a better version.
But here's the main thought I had upon leaving A  Christmas  Carol.
The story is endlessly malleable of course and has been done in everysetting from TV sitcoms to lavish feature films. But the vast majority of
them remain pretty darn faithful to the details of the novella by
Charles Dickens. From versions starring Mr. Magoo to Alistair Sims toPatrick Stewart, they know the bones of a good story when they see itand leave well enough alone.
So the many, many diversions and additions by Jack Thorne this time
out are all the more notable. And unnecessary. And harmful. A storythat's larded with well-earned sentiment doesn't need more. of it.   AMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

THEATER: Another "Christmas</p>
<p>tale positively full of lessons -- as full as a child's stocking by the fire
on Christmas morning   -- does not need those lessons repeated again
and again. A show with warmth to spare does not need bonus hugs.
What it does need is a black box space or a theater in the round. This
Carol  was conceived in the round and Broadway desperately needs
more spaces that can accommodate immersive productions. They can't
all be squeezed into Circle In The Square, after all. Lincoln Center
would be the other ideal space for this, but shows like Hadestowndeserve an ideal setting, not a compromise. So if you go, sit close andon the side to glimpse the in-the-round pleasure of being amidst thefun that director Matthew Warchus charmed up in London.
In general, the vibe is the winner here and you can overlook the sillychanges and enjoy yourself. Carolers and musicians begin playing longbefore the show begins. Cast-members and others like Tim (one of the
gift givers wandering the aisles in good cheer ,not the lad in the show)
cheerfully hand out clementines and cookies before it begins. Bells arerung. The entire space of the theater is used, an echo of the Londonstaging but a poor substitute when Scrooge's nephew must shout his
lines from the upper level. And at the very, very end they play a lovely
carol on the handbells that is sweet and simple and just right for theevening's end.
Scott is quite good and that counts for a lot. But as much as I want to
applaud the generally fine production design and costumes (both by
Rob Howell), the lighting (Hugh Vanstone) and sound design (SimonBaker), they also make some odd choices. The stage is littered withpiles of old, discarded lamps, giant piles of junk that menacinglycapture the ugly spirit of the miserly Scrooge. I assumed these would
rise up and out of the way or be transformed into something nice or
do...something. But those inert piles remained throughout most of theshow, serving no purpose and ultimately proving a distraction. And didthe Spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Future have to be garbed inbathrobes quite so garish and awful? (Andrea Martin and LaChanze
embody two of them with good grace if little effect.)Carol," God Bless 'em

<p>My guest rebelled when the Spirit of Christmas Future was embodied
by Scrooge's sister Little Fan. I found it unbearable when Scroogeliterally hugged his inner child. And no one needed to see Scrooge'sfuneral where his employee Bob Cratchit (a fine Dashiell Eaves), his
nephew and his lost love all repeated their sad feelings we'd already
heard before. All these lardings onto the classic tale have a modest payoff when Scrooge speaks to his one-time love Belle. Sarah Hunt ginsup some genuine emotion and her talk with him at least covers some
new emotional ground, rather than rehashing what Dickens did so
much better before. One can almost overlook Thorne turning thedelightful, jovial Mr. Fezziwig (her father here) into an undertaker ofall things.  
Oh dear, I'm bah humbugging again. The tale is indestructible, thoughThorne takes some awful mighty whacks at it. Say rather it'sindestructible if you leave it alone. But god bless 'em for trying. Godbless them.... See, you wouldn't change that line would you? Whychange anything? You should have a darn good reason and they don't.
Still, God bless Jack Thorne and indeed, everyone.
