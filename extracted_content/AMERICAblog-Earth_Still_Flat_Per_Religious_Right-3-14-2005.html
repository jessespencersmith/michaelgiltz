3/14/2005 01:09:00 PMA depressing article in the Washington Post about how thereligious right is totally mobilized behind attacking evolutionand basic science. They are fighting on a thousand fronts andwinning skirmishes every day. And, frankly, it gets exhaustingexplaining why you don't believe the earth is flat or that theworld is some 40,000 years old rather than billions of yearsold.My God, forty five years ago when we were chasing theRussians in the space race and glorifying science and math,there was no "debate" in schools about the basic tenets ofscience and the fight over evolution was a relic of the past,along with fights over slavery and the rights of women. Nowwe're falling behind in math and science across the board whencompared to Europe and Japan and the far right wants tocondemn Galileo all over again. See a link?
