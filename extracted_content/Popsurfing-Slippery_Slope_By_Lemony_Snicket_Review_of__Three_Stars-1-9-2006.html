            <p>Newer PostOlder PostM O N D AY,  J A N U A RY  0 9 ,  2 0 0 6"The Slippery Slope" By Lemony Snicket -- APopsurfing Review of *** (Three Stars)Just finished Book Ten in An Unfortunate Series of Events, namely"The Slippery Slope." Quite a step up from the last few. The series had-- perhaps unavoidably -- fallen into a bit of a rut. Plucky, resourcefulorphans go to new location or are assigned to new guardians, CountOlaf shows up in disguise, no one believes them at all, and they escapein the nick of time.Now, with the end in sight (Snicket has promised or threatened todeliver 13 volumes) he throws formula to the wind. All bets are off andthe freeing sense of events (however unfortunate) coming to a climaxpowers the tale considerably.The books must be treasured by schoolteachers, celebrating reading,words and definitions with clever wit as they do. I've rarely been morejealous of another writer (what a devastatingly simple idea -- the storyof kids to whom everything awful is sure to befall told by an author whobegs you not to read their tales of woe). Happily, my envy can increasesince Snicket seems to be gathering strength for the grand finale. 3 outof 4 stars.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
