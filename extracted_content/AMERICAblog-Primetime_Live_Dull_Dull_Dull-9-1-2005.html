9/01/2005 10:25:00 PMI miss Peter Jennings. The only interest so far: they began witha quick interview with Sen. Mary Landrieu who may betweaking her message. This time she emphasized thateveryone in charge at the federal level needs to get help thereas fast as possible. Well, that's an improvement, though shefinished by thanking Bush. Again.ADD: A little better now with a segment on race -- such as twowire service photos showing people taking food from a grocerystore. One w black people was labeled as "looters" while theone with white people was labeled "people who found breadand water." Yes, blaming people for not evacuating is idiotic --poor people who don't have cars, can't afford hotel rooms andcan't charter a bus like some hotel guests did. How can thegov't be helpless in evacuating people? Why didn't they declareFriday a school holiday in the South and get every school busheaded to these cities to get people out? Why isn't Greyhoundand Peter Pan etc donating services for a few days...ratherthan allowing people to rent buses for $2500 for a privatecharter as people have described on TV today?
