9/27/2004 03:42:00 PMBush is great at it -- his mere presence seems to lower expectations.They're trying to do it on the debates (Bush's people are alreadysaying they expect him to stumble over words and mispronouncethem) and of course they're doing it in Iraq.Here's a good LA Times article about how the Bushies are loweringexpectations all across the board -- on the Iraqi election, the Iraqieconomy, Iraqi violence, and on and on.Two fascinating tidbits. Everyone keeps deploring how Bush has onlyspent about $1.2 billion on reconstruction, when getting funds to theIraqi people and getting them to work is crucial in most observers'eyes for making progress. But guess what? They haven't evenaccompished that."So far, only $1.2 billion has been disbursed, and so much of that hasbeen eaten up in project overhead and payments to foreign firms thatless than half of it has reached Iraqis, according tonongovernmental experts. Deputy Secretary of State Richard L.Armitage told a House subcommittee Friday that only 77,000 Iraqiswere employed on rebuilding projects. 'That's woefully inadequate,'he said."
