            <p>(opening Friday), Aslan is a mighty
impressive creature: He's voiced
by Liam Neeson, grows literally
larger with each movie - and is a
symbolic stand-in for Christ.
But Aslan is far from the first
king of the jungle to dominate
the movies. Lions have been
roaring their way across the silver
screen since the earliest silent
film travelogues in deepest Africa.
Hollywood loves royalty almost
as much as it loves violence
- and lions embody both of these
qualities (no wonder MGM uses
a lion as its logo). Here are some
of the noble creature's most
memorable movie moments.aspian may be a prince
of Narnia, but Aslan is
king. In'The Ghronides of
tlarnia: Pdnce Gaspiad'
A BORN FREE (1966)
lfs good to be tte king: Elsa the Lioness became
arguably the most famous lion in history when a book
and movie about her life reentering the wild became
massive worldwide successes. The movie spawned a
sequel, a TV show and even a hit song, The actors in
the film became fierce animal rights activists.
But heaW lies the crcwn: Elsa died of a rare blood
disease. However, her cubs or their descendants are
believed to still be roaming the Serengeti.lfs grood to be the ling: Bert Lahr snaps and
growls with silly abandon when the Scarecrow
Tin Man and a little girl cross his path in Oz.
"Put'em up!" he purrs.
But heavy lies the cnrwn: Dorothy (Judy
Garland) soon finds out why he's dubbed the
Cowardly Lion. Just a little pat on the nose
sends him away crying. lf only he could find
some courage.
THE GHOST AND
THE DARKNESS (1996)
lfs good to be the king: Two ferocious lions
snack on the crews brought into East Africa to
build a railway bridge around the turn of the
century, Based on a true story in which the lions
gorged on more than 130 workers.
But heavy fies the crown: Time for a diet?
Engineer Val Kilmer decides enough is enough
and calls in great white hunter Michael Douglas.
The lions - dubbed "the chost" and "the
Darkness" - know the gig is up when movie
stars arrive.
TARZAN THE APE MAN
(1932)
lt's good to be the king: Tarzan (Johnny
Weissmuller) is bloody and exhausted from
winning over Jane and fighting off the white
man when he must wrestle and kill not one. but
two vicious liilns.
But heavy lies tlte qown: PETA is nowhere
in sight. Tarzan puts on a choke hold and then
stabs the lions to death. A third lion comes in for
the kill on the weary ape-man, but an elephant
rescues our hero at the last moment.A THE WTZARD OF OZ (1939) A THE LION KING (1994)
lfs good b be the king: All the animals pay
homage to King Mufasa who lords over the
jungle with wisdom, courage and the stirring
voice of James Earl Jones. The bifth of his son
Simba is practically a national holiday.
But heilry les fte down: That green-eyed
monster, jealousy, is even more powerful than
the king. Scar (Jeremy lrons) lures Mufasato his
death and convinces Simba it's the boy's faulL
which sends the kid into self-imposed exile.
GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE
(1997)
It's good b be the ling: With the great white
hunter (Thomas Haden Church) running away
in fear, a lion has the tasty morsel Ursula (Leslie
Mann) all to himself.
But heaW lies the qown: That is, until
George (Brendan Fraser) shows up, pile-driving
the lion in classic wrestling fashion. How
humiliating, especially since ifs all a put-on to
irnoress the tourists.
BIG TOP PEE.WEE (1988)
lfs gtood to be the hng: When the circus
comes to town, a lion escapes and lies in wait
at Pee-wee's (Paul Reubens) house. When he
walks in, the lion - in classic cartoon fashion
- pictures Pee-wee as a giant steak. "Nice
kitty," says a skittish Pee-wee as he backs away.
But heany lies the cruvn: "Who's a fluffy
kitty?" giggles Pee-wee moments later, after
taming the lion - and making a new friend
- with his nerdy charm. Too bad the lion tamer
and his nasty whip are soon on the scene.
