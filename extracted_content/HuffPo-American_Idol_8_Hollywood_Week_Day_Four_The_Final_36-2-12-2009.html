 American Idol  -- Hollywood Week
Day Four: The Final 36

OK, a long night finally gives us the top 36.
Surely some of the difficulty in sorting everyoneout begins with the fact that they've made thefinal group before determining the Top 12 biggerthan ever. Of course the big news was thedisqualification of Joanna Pacitti after she gotput into the final 36.  I was a little stunned she
actually made it that far -- not because of herconflicts of interest (friends with Idol producers,etc.) but because she stumbled every single stepof the way. During Hollywood Week, she forgotthe lyrics EVERY SINGLE TIME. How could
anyone who forgot their lyrics throughout three (or more) different performances possibly deserveto go forward? If you're wondering why she got through last night and then was eliminated today,don't forget this was all taped months ago, including her getting in and Felicia Barton getting theboot. To avoid ruining the drama, they just kept the news that Pacitti had been booted until afterthe episode aired. But the judges were still wrong.
The ratings were strong, up a tick from the night before and down a modest 7% from a year ago,
according to MediaWeek's Marc Berman.  That means an audience of about 25 million people and
bigger than the other four networks combined from 8-9 p.m. and a little less from 9-10 p.m.Berman also insists that putting forward Tatiana Del Toro and Nick Mitchell that Idol has nothingto do with talent and everything to do with oddball personalities. I have a good friend who alsoinsists the show is not about singing -- it's about stories.
I strongly disagree. First, there's a big difference between how the show is edited to entertain
audiences (especially before the Top 12) and the selections made. Yes, people like Tatiana and Nickseemed to get through because the producers wanted them. Still ,we heard Simon objectingstrenuously about Nick and possibly about Tatiana as well. Nothing really matters until the Top 12.And once we hit the Top 12 it's clear that the judges ARE focused on talent, despite some oddringers that slip through like Sanjaya. This is why the top 12 has consistently produced successful

<p>Michael Giltz: American Idol -- Hollywood Week Day Four: The Final 36
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/emamerican-idolem----holl_b_166413.html [4/5/2009 12:23:55 PM]recording artists and performers who have released singles and albums that have sold millions in
numerous genres, performed on Broadway, won Emmys, won Oscars and on and on. The list of
talent the show has produced is impressive and growing more every year and it all comes from that
Top 12 talent pool. If the show was focused on goofballs a la The Real World, it wouldn't have that
track record and we wouldn't still be watching.
The big twist last night was the Sing Off. In the past, the selection ended with two contestants
coming in together and the judges choosing between them, forcing a miserable time on everyone
because the winner felt like they couldn't celebrate and the loser had the shame of standing by
while someone else gets ahead. So why not have LOTS of awkward moments? At least it was based
on more singing.
We had three Sing Offs during the two hour show and it certainly made for good TV, thanks to the
fact that each guy could hear the other one perform. At least they had the good taste not to face offGokey and Rogers, which would have been silly since everyone knew Gokey was going through.
CODY SHELDON VS. ALEX WAGNER-TRUGMANThe first Sing Off was the best, thanks to the fact that the two guys liked each other and Alex
seemed genuinely upset about seeming to get through at the expense of his friend. Cody didn't
really sing the lyrics so much as just perform words and phrases -- an ok voice but if you can't tell a
story, it doesn't matter. Alex to me was much better with "Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me"
even though he started in too high a key (and immediately walked away and whispered the same
opinion after I'd already written it down). They were very metrosexual while comforting each
other, which was nice to see and Alex appealed as a person for his reaction to the situation. He's
got to change that last name, though. How about just Alex Wagner or Alex T?
JENN KORBEE VS. KRISTEN MCNAMARANeither one was very good in my book. Jenn sang a Dixie Chicks tune and Kristen was a tad better
singing "I Will Always Love You." Paula seemed to call Kristen insane, which is pretty damningcoming from kooky Paula but the women seemed to prefer Kristen and the men the prettier Jenn.When the women suggested why not just have all models singing, Simon seemed to think that wasa perfectly good idea. Kristen remains clueless -- in the midst of a sing off when it's clearly one orthe other, she sat next to Jenn but remained completely oblivious to the girl and the awkwardnessof the situation and stayed focused on herself and how she hoped she would get through.Nonetheless, she got through. I feel worse and worse for Nancy every episode.
FRANKIE JORDAN VS. JESSE LANGSETH
Simon at his bluntest best. He comforts the loser Frankie by telling her, "You wouldn't have won
anyway" and when that brings out moans from the other judges, he tops it by telling Jesse -- thegirl who just made the final 36 -- "You won't win either." Hilarious. And true.
JACKIE MIDKIFF VS. NATHANIEL MARSHALL
Jackie sang "When A Man Loves A Woman" but we found out that Nathaniel's mom has been (or
is) in prison and of course he cries at the drop of a hat. Putting all that aside, Nathaniel was a tadbetter and gets through. But Simon could have given the same speech to both of them that he gaveto the last group: Jackie wouldn't have won and Nathaniel won't win either.
MICHAEL SARVER VS. MATT BREITZKEThe two tough guys, a wildcatter on an oil rig and a welder. Why was Sarver in this spot? He got
stronger and stronger throughout Hollywood Week so what were they wondering about? It justseemed an easy way to flip the drama and put them both through.
The music cues were also fun last night: Anoop got a funky soul track, Gokey and Rogers got Mazzy
Star as Gokey said goodbye to his best friend and wittiest of all, Nick Mitchell (who got throughbecause he promised to keep goofing around as his alter ego) broke down to the tune of "Tears of AClown."
So what did you think of the Sing Off? Cheap stunt or was it at least nice to see them refocus on
singing? How about the Top 36? Voting starts next week, but obviously the Top 12 seems destinedfor a handful like Danny Gokey, Anoop, Lil Rounds, Alexis Grace, Adam Lambert, 16 year old

They should call it:
"The Greatest American Karaoke Singer"...Simon Cowell has no respect for music, he wants models. 
Time to cancel this travesty.

I cannot stand Tatiana, she should have gone home but I think they've kept her in for the drama. If shegets through to the final 12 I will eat my hat. Simon would know there's no commercial gain in havingher stay much longer. She wreaks of desperation - not an attactive facet to anyone's personality.

I'm with you on the first three. The rest I couldn't care less. And while I agree that Tatiana isannoying and can only be happy when she talks to the mirror while batting her lashes atherself, I have to admit that she can sing. Oh, the drama.
