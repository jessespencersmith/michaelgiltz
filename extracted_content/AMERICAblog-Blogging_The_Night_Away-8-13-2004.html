8/13/2004 12:54:00 AMLike our godlike creator -- John in DC -- I, too, have been away.(Actually in Toronto going on the set of a new TV movie version ofKojak starring Ving Rhames. So hello Rob of Baltimore. Now what sayyou to Carl with a K's comment: are the details of a poll's breakdowncalled "internals" or "cross tabs?" Or has "internals" morphed into aphrase covering both polls done by a campaign itself to judge whereit's at AND the more detailed analysis of a poll showing where votersstand on their attitudes towards a particular candidate, what issuesthey consider important, etc? Inquiring minds want to know andclearly you know.
