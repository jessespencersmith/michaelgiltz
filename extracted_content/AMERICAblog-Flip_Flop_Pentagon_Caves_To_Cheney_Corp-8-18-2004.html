8/18/2004 12:55:00 PMOn Monday the Pentagon said it was extending the deadline forHalliburton to explain its billing for the third time. (I wish my editorswere as understanding.) On Tuesday it said it was getting tough andwithholding 15% a month in payments (some $60 million) untilHalliburton subsidiaries got their act together. Today, the Pentagoncaved again. The company has some $6 billion in contracts, many ofthem no-bid contracts that no other company had a chance tocompete for.But don't worry Cheney fans -- if the Pentagon had stuck to itsget-tough policy, Halliburton had a plan:"Halliburton said its subsidiary would offset any loss by simplykeeping 15 percent from payments to subcontractors."Yep, stick it to the little guy.
