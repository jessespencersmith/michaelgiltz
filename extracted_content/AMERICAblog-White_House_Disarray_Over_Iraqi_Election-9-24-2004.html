9/24/2004 03:41:00 PMThe Bushies are in total disarray over the Iraqi elections. It's just likeeveryone keeps quoting a different number on the Iraqi securityforces that are fully trained -- anywhere from 22,000 to a couplehundred thousand depending on the speaker and the time of day.The Iraqi elections WILL be held in January says Bush and his Iraqilackey Allawi. And everyone will vote and everything is going fine.The Iraqi elections will be held in January says Rumsfeld and ofcourse there's so much violence that 20% or more of the Iraqi peoplemay not be able to vote and that's just fine.Now, the second in command in the State Department flatlycontradicts Rumsfeld and says, no, it ISN'T fine to hold electionswhere a huge chunk of the population can't vote. Those are what'sknown as illegitimate elections that won't foster democracy in Iraq orlegitimacy for the government anywhere in the world.And as Steve Clemons points out on his blog, there will be virtuallyno election monitors in Afghanistan and no one is even talking aboutelection monitors in Iraq. Again, by the basic standards of afunctioning democracy, that means both of these elections will beillegitimate in the eyes of the world.The Bushies are way off message and contradicting each other everyday in a Keystone Kops manner. Wanna bet this latest blip is a smallbit of revenge by Colin Powell?
