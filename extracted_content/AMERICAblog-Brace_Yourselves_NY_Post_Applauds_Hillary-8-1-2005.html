8/01/2005 12:20:00 PMYes, hell has frozen over and the New York Post has praised astance of Hillary Clinton in a lead editorial. Specifically, Hillarybelieves we need to expand the Army by 80,000 soldiers. TheArmy has resisted in recent years because soldiers areexpensive. If they add 80,000 new troops (which need to behoused and fed and paid, etc.) they'll have to sacrifice buyingsome of their shiny new toys. Massively expensive newweapons are fun, of course, but as Iraq proves you secure thepeace with boots on the ground.Hillary Clinton and Joe Lieberman are doing what membersof the loyal opposition are supposed to do.They are stepping up to the plate with a legitimate proposalthat neither the administration nor the Republicancongressional majority can reasonably ignore.Good policy makes good politics.It would be ironic if Mrs. Clinton converted herself into thecandidate most earnestly committed to ensuring that theU.S. Army has the tools necessary to win this war. But if ithappens, the president and his party's leaders will have noone to blame but themselves.Now, Hillary isn't "repositioning" herself -- as a First Lady andadvocate on social issues, Hillary didn't have a record on the military.So she's not backtracking on any former stance. All one could do isimply that her husband was anti-military, but that would be a lie.Besides, as the NY Post points out, she happens to be right.So conspiracy theorists, put on your thinking caps:1. The New York Post wants Hillary to be the Democratic nominee soit's lying.2. Hillary is lying so she can "pretend" to be tough on terror, get intothe White House and go back to being the super-left liberal we alwaysthought she was.3. As Senator of New York, Hillary is dealing with a state that facedthe biggest attack on our soil in this nation's history. She's become anexpert on military issues and this sober, reasonable proposal reflectsthat. Hillary is being honest and straightforward. And the NY Postagrees with her. Or is that too boring?
