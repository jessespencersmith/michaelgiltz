8/12/2005 07:37:00 PMIs Karl Rove distracted or something? The Bush White House isin serious disarray. First, Bush and Rummy seemed to sparover what to call this titanic struggle we're apparently engagedin. Rummy rebranded it as the "global struggle against violentextremism." Bush slapped that down by referring to the "waron terror" at least 57 times when he spoke publicly soon after.(The Weekly Standard and other Bush cheerleaders used thatas another excuse to call for Rummy's head.)Now it's Bush vs the generals. He seemed to be floating a trialballoon via our generals by having them talk about pulling backsome troops in the spring, now that everything is going soswimmingly in Iraq. Either that mid-term election ploy was toonaked or the obvious fact that Bush had suddenly named thedeadline he insisted was dangerous finally sunk in. Whateverthe reason, now Bush is saying hold on, we can't be talkingabout pulling out troops and undermining the war effort. Bushreferred to the statements by his top generals as "rumours"and "speculation." The Washington Post called the confusion acase of "seemingly mixed signals" and suggested Bush's peoplewere no clearer than anyone else about what should behappening or when.Either the Bush White House is having trouble keeping peopleon message or there is a real struggle over the direction theyshould be heading in and that fight is sowing disarray in theAdministration. But with Rove preoccupied, the only tingcertain is that chaos is in control in the White House.
