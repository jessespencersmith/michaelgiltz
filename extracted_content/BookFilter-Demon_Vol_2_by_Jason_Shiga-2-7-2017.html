Demon, Volume 2
by Jason Shiga, Jason Shiga
Price: $19.99 (Paperback)
Published: February 07, 2017
Rating: 0.0/ 5 (0 votes cast)
From the Publisher: The OSS is after Jimmy, and they're planning on using
his daughter to catch him. But Jimmy will tear the world apart to keep his
daughter safe. Literally. This morally bankrupt immortal freak of nature
has absolutely no concern for the wellbeing of any human being besideshimself and his Sweetpea. It'd be adorable if it weren't so scary. From thebrilliant and profane mind of Jason Shiga, known for his high-concept
comics work on the web and in print, comes a magnum opus: a four-
volume mystery adventure about the shocking chaos (and astronomicalbody count) one highly rational and utterly sociopathic man can create inthe world, given a single simple supernatural power.

What We Say
This comic book is probably too violent for even Quentin Tarantino to turn into a movie...which is exactly why he'll want to
try. It's super violent, super funny and super clever, which is quite a lot of supers. I wasn't completely sold on Volume 1. Init, we met Jimmy, a man so upset about the accidental death of his wife and child that he kills himself. Or at least he
TRIES to kill himself. Every time he does so, Jimmy's soul leaps into the body of the nearest living person. Once he figures
this out, Jimmy uses his new-found status as a demon to attempt revenge on the drunk driver that killed his family.Essentially, this means when Jimmy develops a plan, he then stands near the person he wants to inhabit next (a cop, aShare This Book

<p>doctor, whomever), and blows his own brains out so Jimmy's soul will leap into that body. It's a loopy idea and at first a
little repetitive, though Shiga did come up with some grand twists in this twisted adventure. Still, I felt it had run its course
by the end of Volume 1. And this is a four volume series? Turns out he was just getting going. In Volume 2, Jimmy is being
hunted by a secret government agency desperate to use his demon powers to topple bad governments. So they're the goodguys, sort of, until they use Jimmy's daughter (she's a demon, too, apparently, so she's still alive) to blackmail him. Theresulting bloodbath is hilariously complicated and fun as Jimmy kills his host bodies to accomplish remarkably elaborateplans to thwart the government. The story builds and builds like the best action films but a comic book may be the best if
not the only medium for this insane idea to work with such reckless abandon. From being uninterested in Volume 2, I'm now
chomping at the bit for Volume 3 and 4. Go Jimmy! (Just don't kill me, please.) -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
Praise for Jason Shiga and the Demon series:
"I truly think Demon is one of the best comics that has come out in the last few years. It's surprising, unique,and insanely well crafted." âBrian Michael Bendis, author of the Ultimate Spider-Man series
"Jason Shiga has done something remarkable with Demon: created a surpassing morally repugnant protagonist I
still root for because of his prodigious intelligence. I'm ashamed of myself for liking him!" âAdam Savage of
MythBusters
"Itâs bizarre, sick, funny, and more than a little depraved, all of which is part of its charm." â Nerdist
I respect Jason so much for following his audacious, wild, insane muse. Demon is raw, explosive fun.â âChesterBrown, author of Paying For It
"Crazy + Genius = Shiga!" âScott McCloud, author of The Sculptor
"Murder and suicide have never looked so adorable." â Booklist
