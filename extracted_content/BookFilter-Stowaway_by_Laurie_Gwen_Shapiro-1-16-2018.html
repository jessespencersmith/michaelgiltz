The Stowaway
A Young Manâs Extraordinary Adventure to Antarctica
by Laurie Gwen Shapiro
Price: $26.00 (Hardcover)
Published: January 16, 2018
Rating: 0.0/ 5 (0 votes cast)
From the Publisher: The spectacular, true story of a scrappy teenager
from New York’s Lower East Side who stowed away on the RoaringTwenties’ most remarkable feat of science and daring: an expedition toAntarctica. It was 1928: a time of illicit booze, of Gatsby and Babe Ruth,
of freewheeling fun. The Great War was over and American optimism was
higher than the stock market. What better moment to launch anexpedition to Antarctica, the planet’s final frontier? This was the moonlanding before the 1960s. Everyone wanted to join the adventure.
Rockefellers and Vanderbilts begged to be taken along as mess boys, and
newspapers across the globe covered the planning’s every stage. The nightbefore the expedition’s flagship launched, Billy Gawronski—a skinny, firstgeneration New York City high schooler desperate to escape a drearyfuture in the family upholstery business—jumped into the Hudson River and
snuck aboard. Could he get away with it? From the grimy streets of New
York’s Lower East Side to the rowdy dance halls of sultry FrancophoneTahiti, all the way to Antarctica’s blinding white and deadly freeze, LaurieGwen Shapiro’s The Stowaway  takes you on the unforgettable voyage of a
gutsy young stowaway who became an international celebrity, a mascotfor an up-by-your bootstraps age.

<p>TWO other people doing the same damn thing? Nonetheless, the fact that Gawronski is long dead and the remaining
documents about him offer thin material means this book is padded with extraneous detail. It also gives short shrift toanother young voyager who probably deserves better but is treated like a nominal villain. What would have been a
fascinating article that might have left us wanting more has become a book that leaves us wanting a little less. Still, it's
entertaining, interesting and will satisfy those who are as crazy for adventures into parts unknown as the young Billy. --Michael Giltz
