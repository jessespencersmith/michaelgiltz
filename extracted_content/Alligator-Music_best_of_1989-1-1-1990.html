By Mkhael GlItz 
it was a poor year for movies, 
but a great one for music. Excel­
lent releases came from all areas 
of music -pop, country, jazz, 
Broadway, soul and especially 
rap. This was the year that na­
scent genre of rock came into its 
own. 
Previously, rap was lyrically 
concerned with boasts about 
sexual prowess and bragging 
about who was the best rapper. 
Like heavy metal, it also seemed 
to be dominated by misogynist, 
racist, and homophobic songs 
and artists. 
All that changed in 1989. The 
militancy of Public Enemy was 
replaced with a rush of artists 
that capitalized on innovative 
sampling to spread a message of 
. positivity. Excellent albums 
" were released by the Jungle 
Brothers, Kool Moe Dee, the 
'Beastie Boys and De La Soul. Rap also in­
fluenced 
Neneh Cherry 
and Soul II 
Soul, a 
dance/ soul 
outfit that had 
tremendous 
success with 
its debut 
alb\Jm and the 
great singles 
"Keep On 
Movin'" and "Back To Life." 
The mood of consciousness­
raising even spread to main­
stream artists like Janet Jackson 
and the Neville Brothers. 
The following are 10 of the 
best albums of '89 -a difficult 
choice since the 10 runners-up 
would make an excellent list in 
a less-fruitful year. They are 
listed in order of preference, but 
the distinction is a minor one. If 
anything here piques your inter­
est, it is definitely worth seeking out. That's the 
whole point of 
Top Ten lists 
anyway. 
k.d. langl 
Absolute 
Torch and 
Twang -This 
is the third 
and best 
album yet 
from country 
artist Lang. 
She once claimed to be the rein­
carnation of Patsy Cline, and 
anyone who has heard her sing 
would be hard pressed to dis­
agree. The album mixes terrific 
originals with achingly good 
cover versions of classic tunes, 
proving that Lang will be 
around for a long time to come. 
De La Soull3 Feet High and 
Rising -What makes these rap­
pers so exciting is their furious 
mix of samples taken from 
Steely Dan, French language • • 
tapes and everything in be­
tween. They change beats and 
rhythms at a speed that makes 
even the MTV generation's head 
spin. It's all topped with witty, 
incisive lyrics and a silly game 
show concept that frames the 
songs. Very fun. 
The Pogues/Peace and Love 
-These Irish rockers are a 
drunken mix of the Clash and 
the Chieftains and they just 
keep getting better, Lead singer 
Shane MacGowan is still the 
focal point, but a greater num­
ber of the lads join in on writing 
and vocal duties. Traditional 
Irish ballads stand side by side 
with political tirades and alco­
hol-soaked reveries. World­
class music. 
Mandy Patinkin/Mandy 
Patinkin -Patinkin is a Broad­
way star who has appeared in 
numerous musicals, including

<p>.. f I 1 I " ~ J. 
the lead i~ Stephen Sondheim's 
Sunday • In., The Jiuk Wi~h George. 
He's a prodigious talent and this 
collection of show tunes and stan­
dards is the best of its lind since 
Barbra Streisand's The Broadway 
, Album. Patinkin rips into songs 
like "Pennies from Heaven" a'l\a 
"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?" 
with overwhelming intensity. 
Only once, on "Me and. My 
Shadow," does he seem over­
wrought. The rest is sheer great­
ness. 
Chris Isaak/Heart Shaped 
World -He looks like James Dean 
and sings like a cross between 
Elvis Presley and Roy Orbison. 
Yes, he's that good, and this is his 
third excellent album of clean, pre-cise pop songs. Why Isaak isn't a 
major star is one C?! the great mys­
'teries of the ~80s. 
Bob DylaplOh Mercy -Dylan 
has been very consistent during 
the last decade. Whenever he 
wrote 'his own songs, the results 
were terrific. The last time that 
happened was Empire Burlesque, a 
good set of tunes marred by over­
production. Before that was the 
exceptional Infidels. After a mish­
mash of live albums and ragged 
covers of other people's songs 
comes another great album. It's 
aided greatly by the marvelous 
touches of producer Daniel 
Lanois. "Most of the Time" and 
"Political World" rank with his 
very best and the rest are almost as good. 
Rickie Lee Jones / Flying 
Cowboys -Sfle's slow, but the 
wait is worth it. These songs are 
more open and emotional than 
those found on The Magazine and 
producer Walter Becker of Steely 
Dan has framed them in some of 
the most propulsive and jazzy set­
tings Jones has enjoyed yet. That 
quirky, marvelous voice is also in 
great shape. Jones sounds relaxed 
and playful and her confidence 
shines through. 
Elvis Costello/Spike -The best 
song Costello has recorded in a 
while is his duet with Paul McC­
artney, "You Want Her Too." 
That's on Paul's album, but Spike 
is no slouch either. It is filled with tharp, biting songs and one of the 
nastiest attacks on Margaret 
Thatcher (or anyone> ever re­
corded. Considering the hate she 
inspires among liberal British art­
ists, that is saying quite a lot. Spike 
proves again that Costello is one 
of the best lyricists around. 
Philip Glassl1000 Airplanes On 
The Roof -Yet another piece from 
the prolific composer. Best known 
for his operas, the side projects of 
Glass can occasionally be just re­
hashes of previous themes, such as 
his flaccid score for Powaqatsi. But 
this chamber opera stands quite 
firmly on its own by spicing up his 
familiar, repetitive style with 
more choral music than Glass has 
used before. Ominous and involv-ing. 
Lou Reed/New York -The best 
solo album yet from the former 
head of the Velvet Underground. 
With two guitars, drums, bass and 
a clutch of great songs, Reed takes 
an angry, topical look at the world 
around him. Bracingly good, New 
York actually lives up to its title. 
The very noteworthy runners­
up are Anything Goes/ New studio 
recording conducted by John Mc­
Glinn, Beastie Boys/Paul's Bou­
tique, Various Artists/Brazil 
Classics Volume I and 11, Frank 
Morgan/ Mood Indigo, The Neville 
Brothers/Yellow Moon, The Pix-' 
ies / Doolittle, Soul II Soul/Keep On 
Movin', XTC/Oranges and Lemons 
and Neil Young/Freedom.</p>
