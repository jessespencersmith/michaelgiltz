            <p>A handful of the season's most 
anticipated popcorn fare for gay and 
lesbian audiences By c ael Iitz 
Now playing or 
open~ng soon 
The Holy Girl (now playing, limited): 
When a man who brushes up against 
teenage Amalia sexually in public starts 
to date her mother, Amalia decides he 
must be saved-apparently, by placing 
herself in tempting proximity to him 
again and again. There's a hint of lesbian 
subtext. Executive-produced by Pedro 
and Agustin Ahnod6var (among others). 
(Fine Line)

Mysterious Skin (now playing): See re­
view, page 68. (Tartan USA/TLA) 
Queer Quotient: ********* 
Mad Hot Ballroom (now playing, limit­
ed): This crowd-pleaser about the thou­
sands of New York City fourth-and fifth-graders who take part in an intensely 
competitive ballroom competition-sort 
of a SpeUbound with music-is great 
fun. The finale might have been scripted 
by Hollywood. (Paramount Classics) 
Queer Quotient: ** 
Ma Mere (May 13, New York City, Los 
Angeles): Isabelle Huppert plays a 
widow who decides to introduce her 17-
year-old son (Louis Garrel, The Dream-
THE ADVOCATE I. I MAY 24, 2005 ers) into the pleasures of sex via her old 
girlfriend, and then her new girlfriend, 
and then a little group orgy with some 
sadomasochism on the side. 
Rated NC-17. (TLA) 
Queer Quotient: ******** 
Fixing Frank (May 20, Los Angeles): 
Out actor Dan Butler (Praiser) stars as 
Dr. Arthur Apsey, a whip-smart psychol­
ogist who specializes in "reparative ther­
apy" for gays. Frank (Andrew Elvis 
Miller) is posing as a patient to try to ex­
pose Apsey as a fraud, but it's soon dev­
ilishly unclear who is using whom. 
Queer Quotient: ********* 
Julie Johnson (May 25, limited): Li1i 
Taylor plays a wife and mom who takes 
a night class in computer science and 
finds she has a real gift-not to mention 
a real attraction to her best pal (Court­
ney Love). Shot five years ago. (Regent) 
Queer Quotient: ******* 
Saving Face (May 27, limited): Out 
writer-director Alice Wu's festival fa­
vorite is a low-key charmer about a 
Chinese-American lesbian (Michelle ~</p>

thority falters when she shows up preg­
nant and refuses to say who the father 
is. (Sony Pictures Classics)

June 
High Tension (June 3): Classic '70s 
slasher films are given an intelligent but 
tense update with this French horror 
film set in a deserted farmhouse. When 
high schooler Marie spies on pal Alexia 
in the shower, you know the boogeyman 
can't be far away. (Lions Gate) 
Queer Quotient: ****** 
Lords of Dogtown (June 3): 
Hot dudes abound in this fictionalized 
yarn about the California surfers who 
turned skateboarding into the coolest 
sport in the country. With Johnny 
Knoxville and Heath Ledger in support­
ing roles. (Columbia TriStar) 
Queer Quotient: ** 
The Adventures of Shark Boy & 
Lava Girl (June 10): Queer kids will eas­
ily identify with this 3-D family film from 
writer-director Robert Rodriguez (Sin 
City, Spy Kids )-the story of a 10-year­
old loner who spends the summer alone 
with his imaginary friends. (Dimen­
sion/Columbia TriStar) 
Queer Quotient:** (for that title alone) 
Heights (June 10, limited): 
See cover story on page 54. (Sony 
Pictures Classics) 
Queer Quotient: ***** 
Mr. and Mrs. Smith (June 10): 
A married couple-both secretly profes­
sional assassins-are bored with their 
life until each gets an assignment to kill 
the other. Not queer, but it's got Brad 
Pitt for the guys and Angelina J olie for 
the gals. (20th Century Fox) 
Queer Quotient: * 
Batman Begins (June 17): The Dark 
Knight has always had a homoerotic 
undercurrent-and Joel Schumacher's 
Batman & Robin proved that "under" is</p>
<p>where it should stay. This reimagining of 
Batman's early years stars Christian Bale 
as the comic-book hero. 'Nuff said. 
(Warner Bros.) 
Queer Quotient: ** 
My Summer of Love (June 17): See re­
view and feature on pages 64-65. (Focus) 
Queer Quotient: ********** 
Bewitched (June 24): Only a John Wa­
ters could come close to the queer quo­
tient of TVs Bewitched, thanks to Paul 
Lynde, Dick Sargent, and the imperious 
Agnes Moorehead. This movie has a 
game cast-Nicole Kidman, Will Ferrell, 
Shirley MacLaine as Endora, and Amy 
Sedaris as nosy neighbor Gladys 
Kravitz-and a very meta plot, about the 
filming of a Bewitched remake in which 
they've unintentionally cast a real witch, 
but the camp factor seems low. 
(Columbia) 
Queer Quotient: *** 
Herbie: Fully Loaded (June 24): See 
feature story on page 60. (Buena Vista) 
Queer Quotient: ***** Rize (June 24): Legendary out photog­
rapher David LaChapelle focuses his 
video camera on the dance craze called 
"krumping." None of the African-Ameri­
can subjects comes out, but the street 
choreography is exhilarating-and may 
go further into the mainstream than 
vogueing. (Lions Gate) 
Queer Quotient: * 
Tropical Malady (June 29, limited): 
This arty Thai critics' favorite delicately 
limns the growing affection between a 
relatively worldly soldier and the 
younger farm boy he romances. Then 
the movie literally stops and begins 
anew, retelling a mythic tale about a wild 
beast and the hunter who must kill it or 
be devoured by it. (Strand) 
Queer Quotient: **** 
July 
Fantastic Four (July 8): 
More comic-book queer subtext, this 
time in the form of an alternative family: 
the Thing, Mr. Fantastic, the Invisible 
Woman, and the Human Torch. (20th Century Fox) 
Queer Quotient: *** 
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 
(July 15): Out screenwriter John August 
reportedly insists he'd never seen the 
Gene Wilder version before adapting the 
Roald Dahl classic into a new vehicle for 
director Tim Burton, starring Johnny 
Depp and Freddie Highmore (Finding 
Neverland) as Charlie. In previews, 
Depp's Anna Wintour look makes pirate 
Jack Sparrow seem positively butch. 
(Warner Bros.) 
Queer Quotient: **** 
Happy Endings (July 15, limited): 
Writer-director Don Roos returns to the 
loopy comic terrain of The Opposite oj 
Sex with this freewheeling comedy. 
Steve Coogan plays the unwitting father 
of Lisa Kudrow's child-he's now 
teamed with his lover (David Sutcliffe) 
in a fight with lesbian friends who may 
be hiding the fact that the men's sperm 
donation actually was successful. Then 
it gets really crazy. (Lions Gate)

Three Dancing Slaves (July 22, New 
York City, Los Angeles): Gael Morel (the 
pillow-lipped star of Wild Reeds) 
cowrites and directs this erotic French 
story of three brothers. The middle child 
thinks he might be attracted to older ex­
con Christophe, and the youngest 
knows he's attracted to his best friend. 
All shot in the most deliriously sexy 
style smce Beau Travail. (TLA) 
Queer Quotient: ******** 
The Reception (July 29, limited): Par­
allel Sons director John G. Young re­
turns with a look at a dysfunctional cou­
ple putting together a party to celebrate 
their daughter's marriage. When groom 
and father-in-law become sexually em­
broiled, there's bound to be some awk­
wardness at the punch bowl. (Strand) 
Queer Quotient: ******** 
Ethan Mao (July, New York City, Los 
Angeles): Quentin Lee's third film com­
bines the tragic characters of Thomas 
Hardy and the love-drunk figures of Kar 
Wai Wong in a thriller modeled on Hitch­
cock. Its hustler hero, with his drug­
dealing boyfriend, impulsively takes his 
own family hostage overnight while try­
ing to reclaim his belongings. (Margin) 
Queer Quotient: ********* 
August and after 
Formula 17 (August, New York City, Los 
Angeles): This swoony romantic comedy 
with a gay spin that became a box-office 
hit in Taiwan. Seventeen-year-old sweet­
heart Tien heads to the big city of Taipei 
for the summer and immediately catch­
es the eye of the biggest playboy heart­
throb in town. It's all very irmocent, so don't expect anything more explicit than 
the latest issue of Tiger Beat. (Strand) 
Queer Quotient: ******* 
The Dukes of Hazzard (August 5): 
Not gay and yet extremely gay. Now a 
new generation can yee-haw it up with 
Bo (Seann William Scott), Luke (Johnny 
Knoxville), and Daisy (Jessica Simp­
son). With Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg. 
(Warner Bros.) Queer Quotient: ** 
Valiant (August 19): Rupert Everett is 
one of the voices in this all-star cast of 
actors giving wing to an animated tale 
about the derring-do of British carrier 
pigeons during World War II. (Buena 
Vista) Queer Quotient: ** 
Asylum (August 19, limited): Sir Ian 
McKellen is the voice of reason in this 
drama set in an insane asylum, with 
Natasha Richardson as the wife of the 
new head who quickly finds herself 
falling for one of the inmates. (Para­
mount Classics) Queer Quotient: ** 
Hardcore (August, New York City, Los 
Angeles): Two runaway teenage girl 
prostitutes in Greece find shelter and 
tenderness in each other's arms-and 
revenge in a series of brutal murders. 
Don't expect a happy ending. (Strand) 
Queer Quotient: ******** 
Dorian Blues (September 2; New York 
City, Los Angeles): This fest fave follows 
the neurotic adventures of gay teen Dori­
an (Michael McMillian), who comes out 
to his parents with deflating results. Un­
deterred, he heads to New York, where 
his Woody Allen-ish dreams of being a 
writer smack up against reality. (TLA) 
Queer Quotient: ********* 
Cote d'Azur (September 9, New York 
City, Los Angeles): The codirectors of 
The Adventures of Felix return with a 
frothy comedy that would set even Kin­
sey's head spinning. During a family sea­
side holiday the teenage son is bonded 
tight to his best friend, who is in love 
with him, while Mom and Dad have 
their own secrets. Then the son's pal 
meets a hot plumber in the dunes, and 
things get really farcical. (Strand)
