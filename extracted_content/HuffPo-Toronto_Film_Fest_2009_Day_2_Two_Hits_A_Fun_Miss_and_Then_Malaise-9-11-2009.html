 Toronto Film Fest Day 2: Two
Hits, A Fun Miss and Then Malaise

Day 2 of the Toronto Film Festival and I'm still
waiting for my friends' dog Momo to get used to
me. He went into a frenzy when I came home last
night, laid in wait outside my room in themorning, leaped at me when I hugged my friendNoriko and barked like crazy until I left. The
(very) quiet streets of Toronto were a relief. Now
where can I find doggie treats?
This morning is the Joel and Ethan Coen movie A
Serious Man , the first test of how easy/difficult Toronto can be. The theater only holds 582 people.
But I had a pleasant surprise: my badge has a little "p" on it which gives me a teensy bit of extra
priority. Hallelujah. But my friends in the longer line got in as well, so Toronto really does seem
hassle-free.
A SERIOUS MAN  *** 1/2 out of **** -- I don't know if I should call this an unexpected treat after
they won the Oscar. But A Serious Man  is so distinctively a Coen Brothers film -- and so successful
-- that it seems like a rebirth. No irony here. No distancing or sour comic tone. No outside source
material. It feels bred in the bone and deeply felt. The story is set in 1967, with our hero a collegeprofessor and Job-like character beset by one trouble after another. (I defy anyone to review thefilm and not  reference Job.) His wife wants a divorce because she's in love with an unctuous man
who constantly hugs Larry Gopnik (a wonderfully restrained Michael Stuhlbarg) and needs todiscuss everything in a reasoned, calm manner that is utterly infuriating. Larry is up for tenure butsomeone is sending anonymous letters denigrating him to the committee. His son is having a bar
mitzvah but is in hock for $20 to the local juvenile delinquent pot dealer. Larry also has to deal
with an awkward bribe from a Korean student that escalates in bizarre ways. Did I mention hisbrother (Richard Kind) is living on their couch, constantly draining some sort of oozing sore? On
the bright side, the sexy neighbor next door bathes in the nude. That's a catalog of plot points, but
not a good summary of the feel of this film. It's the most universal -- and yet the most Jewish --movie the Coens have ever made, even though it has a close kinship with the over the top BartonFink . Of course, getting specific can make any experience universal and that's what they achieve
here. Who hasn't wondered, why me? Who hasn't yearned for answers? Who hasn't thought things

<p>couldn't get worse and then invariably been proven wrong? Their wicked humor is here: Larry is
stranded at a local motel and having a crisis at work when his son calls to complain that the TV
show F Troop  is coming in fuzzy. The series of rabbis and lawyers and doctors all proffer advice,
but when someone has something truly useful to reveal, of course they drop dead in front of him.
It's deadpan but real, funny but sad, absolutely true and a fable for our times. It's such an odd
duck, I thought I might have to start defending it, but the people around me all seemed to be on
the film's wavelength. And yet what does the opener (in which a peasant woman stabs a dybbuk in
the heart) actually imply? The price of not confronting evil head-on? Or the danger of letting fearand mistrust make you act hastily and without reason? One acquaintance called the film a Rosetta
Stone for understanding the Coens. But they've never spoken in a foreign tongue that needed
translating. They just cloaked their fears in comedy and heightened drama. Here, they have the
nerve to stare the trouble right in the eye in this, their most honest film. Me, I'm running away but
it's fascinating to see them not even blink. Can't wait to see it again. Another Oscar contender.
Well, I ran right from A Serious Man  to Jason Reitman's Up In The Air  with a heavy heart. The law
of averages says I'm unlikely to see two really good Hollywood movies in a row.
UP IN THE AIR  *** 1/2 out of **** -- Well, I was wrong. George Clooney and Vera Farmiga make
a sexy couple in this romantic drama with bite. Clooney is a man who specializes in firing people --
he's great at coming into a company for a day, calling in people one by one and "letting them go"
with a wry touch or brief insight that keeps the people from imploding (and more to the point,
from suing). But his real passion is for frequent flier miles. Clooney loves to fly, loves to stay inhotels, loves to rent cars and loves to...avoid life? Unlike in the novel by Walter Kirn, in the filmClooney's character has never been married, perish the thought. When he bumps into fellow road
warrior Farmiga, it's a match made in the Executive Lounge waiting area at JFK. They whip out
hotel cards, compare notes on car companies and click on every level: especially on the level of nocommitment or no fun. Single is what they want. Not even "single," for that implies the potential
for dating, for marriage. Uh-uh. Seeing them spark and trade details of who is in what city when so
they can arrange a play date is contemporary naughtiness at its best. Clooney's air-tight,impersonal, first class life is upended when college grad Natalie (Anna Kendrick) convinces his
company they can fire people over the internet, potentially grounding him forever. She joins
Clooney for a trip to Detroit to gain some hands-on experience and it's a delight to see him andFarmiga cluck over and guide Kendrick both personally and professionally (though they may be theones who need the most help). The film couldn't be more timely, with its compelling montage of
people being fired and then reacting in a thousand different ways. A light romantic comedy, it
gains more gravitas and then smoothly segues to Clooney reconnecting with his family, getting
serious about Farmiga and...well, you can do the rest. But you can't. An easier film might have
stopped there. But Up In The Air  is bolder and goes on quite a bit longer, frustrating our
expectations and avoiding the smooth romantic-comedy landing for an ambiguous crash landingwith Clooney still up in the air about where he wants to go. Not Reitman. He's taken a major leap
forward and Clooney and Farmiga have chemistry to burn. (She's certainly got her eye on a
Supporting Actress nod.) This is sophisticated, adult fare and another potential Oscar contender,especially in a year with ten nominees for Best Picture.
Whew. Two in a row, from Hollywood no less. Others admire Up In The Air  but don't seem quite as
bullish as me. Still, I'll wait for the reviews instead of my tiny sampling of opinion. I see Hollywood
Reporter has already raved  about the Coens film, which I imagine will be the first of many at the
very least respectful reviews. (Respectful is the tone for Variety's take. ) I scramble over to a new
venue (the first time I'm leaving the Varsity on Bay St. above the Indigo bookstore) to catchValhalla Rising , which I know nothing about except there are Vikings.
VALHALLA RISING  ** out of **** An arty Viking film? Why not? From the director of the
Pusher  trilogy, this is a moody and fairly engrossing look at a man captured by other men and
forced to fight to the death other prisoners for their amusement. Our hero has one eye and a
vicious way in the ring (he never loses, never even comes close) and you know it's only a matter oftime before he loosens those chains. A young boy that feeds him teams up with the man when he
escapes (brutally, bloodily -- this is a slow film with exceptionally vivid violence when it strikes).
They team up with/are dragooned into a group of Christian Vikings headed for the Holy Land butsideswiped by a fog into a path for Ireland or perhaps America. Very little happens here, but it
looks very striking and the quirky score -- an organ at one point, at others an anachronistic electric
guitar -- keeps your attention. But despite its would-be commentary on Christian crusaders andtheir bloody spreading of the faith, it all adds up to little more than a lot of atmosphere and just a
little plot. The 90 minutes don't drag, but they don't skip by, either. The 13th Warrior  it ain't.

<p>The rest of the day is a low-key disaster. First, I need to file a profile of Matthew Sweet  before he
performs in New York City tonight. But finding a free Wi-Fi spot (or even one I can pay for easily)
proves frustrating until I discover that Starbucks Canada offers two hours of usage a day free  to
any customer who signs up online. God bless Canada! So I bounce between Starbucks and the pressoffice, secure a midnight movie ticket and then get utterly lost when striking out for a new venue,
even though it turns out to be across the street from the Eaton Centre. The location was much
farther away then I was told.
So I trudge back, only to find out the closest bookstore with a copy of Walter Kirn's Up In The Air
is at the Eaton Centre, so back I trudge, finally spotting the cinema where Solomon Kane , the
movie I missed, is playing. I press my nose up to the box office window and then move forlornlyon. I hit another screening just because the timing works out. The film has the very unpromising
title Melody For A Street Organ  and the Ukranian film doesn't seem much better. The child actors
who star are very forced and the translation of the dialogue is weak. But it's the subtitling itself that
kills me. It's fuzzy, yes fuzzy  and incredibly distracting. After 40 minutes, I give up because I'm
hungry and tired and need to write and all the dialogue is fuzzy , which is awfully tiresome.
Back to the other  Indigo to file this story, when I find out someone contacted me to appear on their
TV show tonight at 9 on CP24 but I didn't check my mail until 8:53 p.m. Oh well. I might try andtalk my way into the midnight showing of the new Ethan Hawke vampire flick or just head home
and read Kirn.
Tomorrow I'm looking forward to a documentary about Disney's animation resurgence (it began
with The Great Mouse Detective , in my book), either a well-reviewed French film I Am Love  or the
new spin on Dorian Gray , either The Trotsky  (a Rushmore -like high school comedy) or The Road
and whatever else I can fit in. I also receive a handwritten (!) invite from the director of a
documentary on Hugh Hefner (which just got a good review in the Hollywood Reporter.) But it
conflicts with the only screening of Trotsky , so I'll take my chances and try to catch it on Thursday.
I definitely don't want to miss it and am sorry I won't be at the premiere with Hefner himself in
attendance Saturday at 2 p.m.

In a time when most of Hollywood can only do remakes, comic book adaptations, and
adaptions of mediocre TV shows the Coen brothers are a treasure. Impossible to pigeon
hole, always trying new things from comedy to drama to various shades in between, and
always finding the best actors and bringing out the best in them. Can't wait to see the new movie.

I've seen only one Ukrainian movie during my life, and it may have been a Ukrainian-Russian co-production. It was    (A Driver for Vera), set in 1962 Yalta. I saw it while I was
in Russia in fall 2006. The main thing that I derived from the movie was that in terms of lifestyle and
culture, anyone could confuse the USSR with the USA (if I remember right, one scene portrayed peoplelistening to American music). I didn't see the whole thing, because the bus on which I was travelingsuddenly jerked and we had to stop and wait for another bus. I never did find out what happened thatmade the bus do that.
Anyway, that movie was worth seeing.
