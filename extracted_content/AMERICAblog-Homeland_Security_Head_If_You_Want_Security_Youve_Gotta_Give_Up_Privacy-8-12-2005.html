8/12/2005 08:33:00 AMUSA Today has an okay interview with Homeland Security headMichael Chertoff. What I missed: hearing how Chertoff is goingto head off the political abuse of his department, namely thepolitical machinations that Tom Ridge said were behind somany of the "terror alerts" during Bush's first four years. WhatChertoff did say: security trumps privacy.Chertoff said there is too much worry over a plan by theTransportation Security Administration to collectpassengers' full names and birth dates before they board."The average American gives information up to get a CVS(drugstore discount) card that is far more in-depth thanTSA's going to be looking at," Chertoff told reporters andeditors at USA TODAY's headquarters in McLean, Va.True -- that's why a growing number of people DON'T sign up forthose cards at grocery stores and drug stores that let them trackevery single purchase you make, sell it to any and all comers andgive you very little in return. Heck, when I buy a battery at RadioShack and they demand my phone number, I get into a five minuteargument every time."Would you rather give up your address and date of birth toa secure database and not be pulled aside and questioned,"he said, "or would you rather not give it up and have anincreased likelihood that you're going to be called out ofline and someone's going to do a secondary search of yourbag and they're going to ask you a lot of personal questionsin the full view of everybody else?"So the choice is to just roll over and give up all your privacy inadvance or we'll single you out for humiliating treatment because ifyou DON'T want to give Big Brother your blood type, genetic codeand first born baby, obviously you have something to hide? That's thesame foolish argument people like to say about unnecessary drugtesting or having your every move tracked by cameras -- if you'vegot nothing to hide, why do you object? Uh, because it's my freedomand privacy I'm trying to protect, not lose. Isn't it?
