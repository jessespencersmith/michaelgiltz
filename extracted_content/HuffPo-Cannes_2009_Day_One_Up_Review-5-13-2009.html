 Cannes 2009 Day One: "Up"
Review
Read More:  Animation , Cannes Film Festival, Disney, Pixar,
Up, Entertainment News
Cannes kicked off with a gentle, sweet even
sublime film: Pixar's Up . As I've written before,
Pixar is on a streak of critical and commercialsuccesses (10 and counting) that is simplyunparalleled in Hollywood history. No star, no
director, no studio has ever accomplished what
Pixar has wrought with its first ten movies. Theyrange from pretty good to good to great toclassic. And every single one has been a major
commercial success. Just listing them is
impressive:
Toy StoryA Bug's LifeToy Story 2
Monsters Inc.
Finding Nemo The Incredibles
Cars
Ratatouille  (now THAT should have opened Cannes!)
WALL-E

<p>Michael Giltz: Cannes 2009 Day One: "Up" Review
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/cannes-2009-day-one-up-re_b_203089.html [6/23/2009 6:16:14 PM]
Up. It has some fine action scenes and witty banter involving dogs equipped with hi-tech collars
that let us hear their thoughts. ("Squirrel!" is a big favorite.) But the lasting impression of this gem
is gentle and sweet. No wonder the filmmakers genuflected at the altar of Hiyao Miyazaki, the
great Japanese animation genius. His sensibility suffuses everything they do.
The story is simple enough: Carl, a grumpy old man (Ed Asner) tries to get away from it all by tying
a ton of helium balloons to his home and floating off to South America. But there's a stowaway: a
genial 8 year old kid desperate to earn his final merit badge by "assisting the elderly." Adventuresensue.
Director Pete Docter (whose long face and jug ears make him look pleasingly cartoonish himself)
mentioned the Pixar concept of "Simplexity" at the film's press conference. That's the idea that
something -- a character, a storyline, an image -- should be easy to grasp at first but have enough
depth and texture that you keep discovering new things every time you return to it.
But even on first viewing you'll be caught up short by the serene opening. They break your heart in
the first ten minutes...twice. In those ten minutes, we see Carl as a shy, almost mute little boyhappily overwhelmed by Elie (voiced by Elie Docter). Her love for famed explorer Charles Muntz
(Christopher Plummer) is even greater than his own. In a brilliant, nearly silent sequence, we see
them grow up, get married, share their dreams, suffer the pain of their inability to have children,grow old together and then sadly say goodbye when Ellie dies. It's a master class in storytelling and
the movie proper hasn't even begun.
But of course it has, because in a great film nothing is extraneous. Those first few minutes set up
the driving desire to see the wilds of South America, cannily explain why explorer Muntz might still
be there decades later trying to clear his name, prepare us for an oddball bird nicknamed Kevin
that is boisterously antic and sweet (they don't make movies to sell toys but boy could Disney sell aton of "Kevins"), and a dark, dangerous finale.
I haven't even mentioned yet the fact that the film is in 3-D, something that should please Pixar to
no end. This is a landmark year for 3-D: Up  and Coraline  will be remembered for being the movies
that turned 3-D from a gimmick into simply another tool, like sound and color. Their use of 3-D isso deft, so organic to the story that it seems perfectly natural. That's something 3-D has neverseemed before.
I'm not convinced that 3-D will become standard for live action films. Mostly, it seems like an
excuse by studios to raise ticket prices. But in animation, 3-D will probably become the standard.
People will still make 2-D animation and they'll still do hand-drawn animation as well, just like
people sometimes make movies in black and white. But 3-D is already becoming so common thatno one thinks it notable or special or strange. If the movie's good, it uses 3-D well. If it's bad, 3-Dwon't help it. With Up , the 3-D is so essential to the emotional effect of the film, I'd hate to watch
it in 2-D, at least for the first time, You'd certainly enjoy it. But you wouldn't know what you weremissing. And Up  in 3-D should not be missed.

At first, I wasn't sure if I'd get into this film until I saw the latest trailer. I've had that reaction
half the time I've seen trailers for upcoming Pixar films, but then I see them and I've alwaysbeen surprised and delighted by them. I hope Pixar can keep their golden touch as
