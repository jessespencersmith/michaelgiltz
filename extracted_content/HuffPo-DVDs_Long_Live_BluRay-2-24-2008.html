DVDs: Long Live Blu-Ray!

Where were you when the format wars were over? HD-DVD is dead. Long live Blu-Ray. With
Toshiba throwing in the towel on HD, everyone is asking me again: should they plunge into Blu-Ray? Not necessarily.
I'm a little bummed the more consumer friendly HD format died. It often contained a regular DVD
version of the movie, so you could build your library even before you bought an HD player. Best ofall, it got rid of the stupid region coding which makes DVDs from overseas incompatible withstandard players. So theoretically if there were a UK TV show or Japanese anime or Australianminiseries you wanted to buy that wasn't going to come out in the US for years if ever, you could.
Oh well. Blu-Ray has won. And yes, Blu-Ray is adramatic improvement over regular DVD.Unfortunately, you have to spend literally thousands
of dollars on a plasma or LCD TV, surround sound
and a new Blu-Ray DVD player to get all those
benefits. On top of it all, Blu-Ray (like HD), is nearly
50% more expensive than regular DVDs. That's right, DVD sales have stopped explodingdramatically so the bright idea of the studios to goose them is to introduce a format that costs
thousands of dollars to watch and is a lot more expensive. Yep, they think Blu-Ray is so wonderful
you'll want to spend a lot more money on it.
Not me. I have no intention of replacing all my DVDs with Blu-Rays. Maybe for a handful of special
titles, like The Lord of the Rings  and (the original) Star Wars.  But most movies? Nope. CDs were a
once in a lifetime phenomenon where everyone replaced virtually their entire collection of LPs withmore expensive CDs. Regular DVDs were one of the most successful product launches inelectronics history for a very simple reason: they were a quantum leap better in quality comparedto VHS, they included tons of extras that VHS never could, they came out at a sale price muchquicker (VHS often took six months to a year to come down from the "rental" price of $100) and ontop of it all (and this is what they always forget) DVDs were the same price or cheaper than VHS.

SNL: Madonna And
 Reality Star Jade
 Robert De Niro
 Alex Da Silva,Almost none of that is true for Blu-Ray.
Blu-Ray is a much improved picture, yes. But the extras aren't much different than what we
normally get. (Despite some bells and whistles more exciting to them than us.) It takes a majorinvestment to get all those benefits and on top of it all, they're more expensive. I don't think Blu-Ray will flop a la the "improved" CDs record labels tried to push on us in the last few years. Butthey might. But they certainly won't start flying off the shelves and it will be years before even halfof all homes can watch Blu-Ray DVDs on a home theater system.
So I say, drag your feet. The longer we take to make the switch to Blu-Ray, the more likely they'll
lower the price so it's the equivalent of regular DVDs. And if the studios think we're all going tohappily replace our library of movies and TV shows on DVD with Blu-Ray, they are in for a rudeawakening.
Also out this week: George Clooney's Michael Clayton  ($28.98/$5.99 Blu-Ray; Warner Bros.) is
such an intelligent, adult legal thriller it seemed to come from a different era; German
Expressionism Collection  ($69.95; Kino), an exceptional boxed set of four German masterpieces in
terrific prints with loads of extras, including the iconic masterpiece The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari
(1919) and G.W. Pabst's Secrets Of A Soul from 1926; Ang Lee's dry but intelligent spy romance
Lust Caution ($29.98; Focus), which isn't defined by its sexual explicitness any more than
Brokeback Mountain  was simply a gay cowboy movie; Father Ted: The Definitive Collection
($79.98; BBC Video), the UK sitcom about Irish priests that leaves Catholics in particular helplesswith laughter; Walker  ($39.95; Criterion), director Alex Cox's oddball biopic about the dictator of
Nicaragua (embodied by Ed Harris) with a thunderous score by Joe Strummer of the Clash; Kurt
Cobain: About A Son  ($19.99; Shout), is a dream-like meditation on Cobain that uses audio
interviews and virtually no images of the artist or his band in concert but rather focuses on theplaces he frequented to commune with his lost spirit; Rendition  ($28.98; New Line), a well-
intentioned drama about a conflicted CIA agent (the always empathetic Jake Gyllenhaal) upset
over the torture of a US citizen handed over to our allies; In The Valley Of Elah  ($27.98/$35.99 on
Blu-Ray; Warner Bros.), another Iraq-linked drama with Tommy Lee Jones giving an Oscar
nominated performance as a dad determined to learn the truth about his late son's tour of duty in
that war-town country; Cops 20th Anniversary Edition  ($29.98; Fox), a two-disc set on the reality
series that will unquestionably celebrate a 40th anniversary and still be on the air; Margot at the
Wedding  ($29.99; Paramount), Noah Bambauch's acidic, unatisfying follow-up to The Squid and
the Whale  has fine acting from Nicole Kidman and Jennifer Jason Leigh in a too-familiar story of
family squabbling; Don Rickles is celebrated in Mr. Warmth  ($26.99; HBO), a rare chance to see
his comedy of insult in action; Madeline: Meet Me In Paris  ($14.98; Fox), is an animated take on
the schoolgirl and after umpteen attempts via TV, cartoons and yet another feature film in theworks, maybe they can admit it simply works best as a picture book and leave it at that; four AlainResnais films from the 80s come to DVD with modest extras, led by 1983's acclaimed bauble LifeIs A Bed Of Roses  ($29.95; Kino); the Easter Bunny simply doesn't have the pull on the
imagination that other holiday characters exert, as proven in two so-so TV specials, The EasterBunny Is Comin' To Town  ($14.98; Warner Bros.), a Rankin-Bass stop-motion show narrated by
Fred Astaire and It's The Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown  ($19.98; Warner Bros.) with the even more
desperate It's Arbor Day, Charlie Brown  special as a bonus; Chaos  ($19.98; Lionsgate), a B movie
bank heist but with Wesley Snipes, Ryan Phillippe and Jason Statham heading the cast, wouldn'tyou have loved to hang out on the set and heard their conversations?; and 1965's Pierrot Le Fou($39.95; Criterion), Jean Luc Godard's final stab at actually entertaining an audience via a madcaproad trip movie shot with élan if not a lot of sense.
So are you going to make the plunge into Blu-Ray? And will you replace all the DVDs you own with
Blu-Ray versions?

Well, no. Tape is pure crap from the beginning. LPs do have great sound -- if you have asuper expensive sound system. But they do easily scratch and pop when played regularly.CDs can be poorly mastered and are not equal to the best LPs with the best sound systems.But for 95% of the people with just an average stereo, the CD is far superior today than theLP. And despite rumors, I have CDs from the early 80s that still play just fine. That's 25 yearsold, which is a hell of a lot better than LPs especially when you consider how much I'veplayed some of them. Mind you, i wouldn't mind replacing the second CD I ever bought ("Born

Great post, Michael.
I've been wondering if Blu-ray won't wind up being the equivalent of Beta for DVD.It's a superior format, but there's really no demand for it. And the timing of releasing an upgraded DVD
format in a depressed economy is just terrible.
Bottom Line: I don't have the eyes of an eagle or the ears of a bat. What I see and hear on DVD right
now is just fine for me and a huge upgrade over VHS. There is just simply no demand for a DVDupgrade right now.
commentguy1234 See Profile  I'm a Fan of commentguy1234  permalink
What the article REALLY misses are the extra costs and annoyances that make Blu-Ray suck: thebroadband internet requirement and the so-called upgrades to the firmware. For, you see, it's not justgreed that drives the hi-def promotion, it's their Ahab like obsession with thwarting piracy. When youfind you can't watch a dvd without first connecting to a database to ensure the movie you have is notpirated, you'll realize you made a huge mistake. When YOUR player becomes a brick because
someone on your network hub unlocked THEIR player, you'll realize you made a huge mistake. When
the studios make a mistake and brick your players because they misidentified your dvd as pirated and
you have to spend months trying to get them to fix it, you'll realize you made a huge mistake. It will
happen. Blu-Ray is a rip-off, and anyone who plunges money on it is a sucker, or has too much money.
Besides, do you really need to see Alvin in the Chipmunks or Norbitt in stunning HD? This isn't the
golden age of movies. It's not even 1985. Not that I wouldn't have wanted to see Molly Ringwald in HD.God, she was hot.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
Molly Ringwald was -- and is -- totally adorable. I did not get into the piracy realm which isanother reason I much preferred HD. Sony is moronically concerned about piracy, putting instupid blocks that just make life miserable for people who never break the law but not reallystoppng real thieves. They're the geniuses who gummed up tons of computers by puttingstupid anti-consumer I mean anti-piracy software onto Neil Diamond's 12 Songs, perhaps thebest album of his career. I knew about the internet options but don't THINK it's essential forworking the player since most people don't have Sony PlayStations and therefore wouldn'thave their DVD players hooked up the internet. But I've no doubt they have all sorts of dumb
thngs in place like you describe. Thanks for bringing it up.

Perhaps Sony will jack the price of the Playstation III back up now as well. Some folks were buying
them because they also served as a Blu-Ray player as well once the price came down.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
I doubt they'll raise the player back up. They're more concerned about regaining market sharefrom Wii. And people who have Blu-Ray via Sony PlayStation are the smart ones: those arethe only players guaranteed to be able to access all the features that Blu-Ray will be offeringby the end of the year. All the other "standard" Blu-Ray players currently out will NOT be able
to access all the features. You'll have to wait for fall and new Blu-Ray players tagged "BD
Live" to not feel ripped off.

So...I'm still using a VHS with tapes.I want to get a DVR do they have DVR with Blu Ray and do I have to get a CD/DVD/Bluray disc drivefor my computer. And what goes with what and what's compatible with what when TV broacasts go todigital in Feb. 2009? Jeez you think those with the power to determine these things would get it right foronce instead of nickel and diming the consumer with out of date equipment.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
You're still using VHS tapes? You def need to get a DVR. I assume you have cable TV. If so,your best bet is usually the DVR service offered by your cable subscriber. If you have a high-def TV (which I doubt given your VHS status), then get a digital DVR service that lets yourecord shows in hi-def. Most computers will NOT play Blu-Ray discs. You'd have to get adrive that was Blu-Ray compatible. The switch to digital signals has no effect on Blu-Raydiscs, since that's just a home viewing format. People accessing TV via rabbit ears are the
ones who will be most affected by the switchover to digital. Assuming you have cable, you'll
either need a relatively current TV or a converter that will switch the signal over. Your cable
provider can tell you if you're ok for the 2009 switchover. But that is entirely separate from
what discs you put into a DVD player.

With the economy what it is, it seems silly that suddenly Blu-ray dvds would be pushed our way. Wereally don't have an extra $30 to spend on a dvd of a movie we liked and will watch one time, andunless it's a movie we absolutely love and have the technology to enjoy in Blu ray, I don't think this isgoing to work. I predict sluggish sales. I'm considering not even changing my tv to "DTV," but instead Imay just stop watching broadcast tv. I have plenty of dvds that play on my regular player, and thepicture is just fine and the sound is fine. It's really not necessary to see every photon and particle and

Now - 'they' inform me (I actually have known for about 2 years) that my rabbit ears won't
work on my TVs come February '09. Or - if I want to keep watching 'free' TV I need to buy aconverter box. 
My DVD player for the last 4 years has been a reliable old Playstation II - and I have no
intention of switching to HD-TV format just so I can spend umpteen $$'s on a plasma TV, andnew Blue-ray compatible CD player, and sound system. 
I'm just going to spend more time out taking nice long walks, and reading some more good
books.

I think you're right. IN a depressed economy, trying to get everyone to pay a lot more for a
product they're already happy with seems like very bad timing. Offering a massively improved
product for the SAME price -- now that would be smart. I def think sluggish sales are ahead
for the forseeable future and it's such a badly done rollout that they might have poisoned it.

The article fails to mention developments in movie watching beyond the DVD format war. BeforeChristmas I purchased 2 HD players (one as a gift) because with HD DVD at lower prices and nodiscernible quality differences I gambled HD would be around for a long time. Within 30 days mypurchases were obsolete. Meanwhile Apple upgraded my already-owned Apple TV overnight and now Ican watch instantly downloaded purchased or rented movies on my HD TV at what is called "near-HD"quality. I think the quality is great and I've set out to rip all my DVDs to Apple TV-playable format. I willno longer buy any format DVDs (sorry Amazon) and stick with Apple, a visionary company that haschanged the MP3 player world and stands to do it again with the way we watch movies. An iTunes-downloaded movie (either purchased or rented) plays on my TV, my Mac (or your PC), as well as in my
iPhone (or your iPod). Sayonara format wars. Apple won your battle.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
David Pogue of the NYT did an article about downloading movies and I agree with him on this
one. First, it's going to be a long time before most people in the US have enough bandwith todownload movies seamlessly. The people with a device like Apple TV are less than 1% of theentire home audience and I don't see sales for them exploding. Netflix is easy. Buying DVDsis easy. Downloading is a bit cumbersome and you get NONE of the extras and bonus discsand commentary tracks that make DVDs so far superior to VHS. To me, it's a step back. Finefor TV shows where there are no extras yet, but weak for movies. Plus, it only ends theformat war if you are devoted to Apple. I hate being linked to one company and basicallynever buy digital files. (I buy my own CDs and rip them onto iTunes. Then, If I get a differentplayer or my computer crashes or whatever, I still have a master copy of the album/movie.
More new movies are allowing you to download a free copy of the film which I think is def the
way to go. If you buy a DVD, you should have access to a download copy that lets you watchit on your laptop or iPhone or other device. Apple's approach is great if you are pure Apple.But the record labels bitterly regret letting Apple get such dominance in online sales and themovie studios are NOT going t give them the same access to movies and TV shows. That'swhy they're library of movies is so weak and will be for a long time. (I know, iTunes was lameat first too; but studios are scared of Apple now.)

Are blu-ray players compatible with today's DVD's?
To be honest, I have yet to see the difference between an HD television and the regular one I have.
I've gone to BestBuy and such and watched their HD's in action, and while the quality is good... I haveyet to see what they're doing that makes them different than standard definition. Maybe I just have badeyesight and I can't see the details.

Maybe?
But you aren't the only one. Are you tone deaf too?

I'm definitely not tone deaf.I'll try watching HD with my glasses on, that might help. :)

Kenai, I have to agree with leftcoastindy. My standard for technology being a major
leap forward is the grandmother test. (Or mother test.) If your mother can tell thedifference between an audio cassette and a CD or a VHS tape and a DVD (and ofcourse she can), then it's a major leap forward I don't know anyone who hasn't been
blown away and been made weak at the knees by hi-def programming on a hi-def
TV. Regular TV shows don't always look dramatically better but sports and natureprogramming in hidef looks just stunning on a plasma or LCD sceen. Typically,
stores have the best setup guaranteed to wow customers. You might indeed want to
get your eyes checked :) And yes, new Blu-Ray players will typically play regular
DVDs as well as Blu-Rays. There were some early incompatibility problems butthose have been resolved. As I mentioned above, there's a new wave of extras thatonly Blu-Ray players released in the fall will be able to accomodate (along withcurrent PlayStations) so if you're not eager, wait.

First DVD player - $650 ($900 today's dollars)
First (1080P capable) Blu-ray player - $360To make viewing DVD's in widescreen format acceptable (picture more than 12" high) I had to
purchase a 16/9 TV - $4000 ($5000 today)
To make all my old DVD's look great on a Blu-Ray player so I don't have to replace my whole
collection, I have to buy an HDMI connected TV - $1200
If you don't already have a surround sound system, you have no business reading this.

Well, not quite. Early DVD players were even more expensive. But all electronics tend to drop
as they go mainstream and until DVD players went below $300 it was considered a luxury,geeks-only product. BluRay players are more expensive than HD-DVD players but no one butearly adaptors buys them until they go below $300. The question is what do you get whenyou buy a player? With a CD player and my junky old stereo, the sound was light years aheadof audio cassettess. With the same old TV I had, DVD players were stunningly better thanVHS tapes. With Blu-Ray on a standard TV, there's an improvement but it's marginal. That'sjust a technical fact. You must spend $1000+ (or much more) on a plasma or LCD screen to
get the full wow effect. Hook up a BluRay to the fine TV I already own (which is not
widescreen) and you don't see much difference at all. That's what most people willexperience. Same TV. VHS tape seems fine until you plug in a DVD player. DVD player isgreat. And when you plug in a BluRay it's a little better but not remarkably so. Not everyonehas a home theater system. Indeed, 80% of households don't have a home theater system.And they want to know, if I buy just a BluRay player the way I bought a DVD player andbefore that a CD player, will I be thrilled? The answer is no. Unlike CDs and DVDs, gettingthe benfit of BluRay is a LOT more expensive. It just is. I've got a perfectly good TV, a Bosespeaker system and hundreds (okay thousands) of DVDs. I'm def going to get a plasmascreen maybe by the end of the year. Should I rush out and get BluRay before that? No.What's the point?

I've already been suckered into LPs, 8-track tapes, compact cassette tapes, betamax, VHS, CDs and
DVDs in both full-screen and wide-screen formats--not to mention noise reduction and multi-channeltechnologies. I'm done being on the bleeding-edge.
Michael Giltz See Profile  I'm a Fan of Michael Giltz  permalink
I hate the bleeding edge, too. That's why I tend to not be an early adaptor even though I loveelectronic toys. By the end of 2009, you should be able to sort out the switchover to digital tvsignals and the BluRay fallout and downloadable movies and a plasma screen tv etc. Untilthen, enjoy your kinescopes.
