 33Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyIdol  Season 9: Top 11 -- Non-

American Idol  said goodbye to Paige Miles and
finalized the Top 10.  That's the group that goes on
tour and from which most every single successful Idol
alum has sprung. (Has anyone been in the Top 12 or24 and made waves that didn't make it to the Top 10?)
So going on tour is:
Crystal Bowersox 
Aaron Kelly
Casey James
Siobhan Magnus
Michael Lynche
Lee Dewyze
Didi BenamiTim Urban
Katie Stevens
Andrew Garcia
And no, that order is not random. That's roughly how I think they'll stack up in the weeks to come, with
Crystal and Aaron in the finale.
The show began with a shocker: at 8:02 I thought I spotted someone in the audience so excited about
Idol  that she didn't realize her nose was bleeding. Turns out friends of Siobhan had dressed up as
zombies.
The Idol  kids sang another horrific lip-sync singalong, this time to the awesome pop classic "Wake Me Up
Before You Go-Go" by Wham. (My favorite version of that tune came in Central Park of New York City. I
was walking through it on a summer's day with my father and brother when a homeless man appeared,
clutching a boombox to his ear, even though I don't believe it was turned on. He started bopping up and
down and suddenly squealed out, "Wake me UP  before you go go!" over and over as he walked through

Growing Babythe grass. Only in New York, as Cindy Adams would say.)
But why are they still doing lip-syncs? And why do the worst singers always tend to be the best lip-
syncers? There's a lesson in there somewhere. Lee Dewyze looked miserable the entire night. He looked
miserable during the sing-along, during the chat with Ryan, during the elimination round and at thefinale.
And Ryan touched on a nerve by showing footage of Michael Lynche walking out of his apartment with
his son. Ryan described him as "babysitting." Uh, you don't "babysit" your own son. Just one more
example of society's deep prejudice against men as parents.
Anyway, that was followed by a notably awkward elimination. Ryan stood up Lee and Casey on one side
and Paige and Tim on the other. Paige was finally told she was in the bottom three. But as Tim started to
sit down he was anti-climatically told that he was in the bottom three as well. But Ryan forgot to tell Lee
and Casey they were safe so they stood there awkwardly even as the show cut to a break.
Miley Cyrus performed her dramatic ballad "When I Look At You" after Ryan informed us that next
week's genre was r&b/soul and the mentor would be Usher. Miley off-handedly said the audience had
given Miley the first standing ovation in her life. Ryan found that hard to believe, as did I, but she seemed
pretty sincere.
Andrew Garcia and Katie Stevens faced off, with Andrew (barely) safe and Katie in the bottom three.
Katie was immediately made safe. Then Joe Jonas and Demi Lovato ( Camp Rock! ) sang a weak
inspirational tune called "Make A Wave." Still, the show has definitely been booking very young-leaning
guests and mentors this season. Finally, to no one's surprise, Paige went home, with the judges politely
telling her even before she sang that they wouldn't use their save.
So what soul numbers would you suggest for your favorite Idol  next week?

There's already only 11 contestant s left on American Idol and since it's pretty obvious who is going
to win, (Crystal Bowersox), I want to know when Season 10 is going to start. There's been alot of
gossip about season 10 being the last year of idol. So if this is true I strongly believe they shouldallow 15 year olds audition for idol! Because the simple fact is there should be no age limit ontalent! I understand not letting a 12 or 13 year old not audition because they might have not hitpuberty yet! So their voice could change drasticall y very quickly. They might be a great singer one
day but then they hit puberty and they could suck! There is noo diffrence between a 15 year old and
a 16 year old!! This could be their only chance to make their dreams come true so let them
audition!! Thank you!
My only problem with that is that I'm looking at some of the 16 year olds and thinking"Wow, they will be great when they are 25!" But they auditioned so young and I really thinksome of them need some more time.
Next season will not be the last for Idol. It will debut in January of 2011 without Simon. In
the fall of 2011, his very similar UK show The X Factor will launch an American edition.That finale comes in December right before Christmas. And then the NEXT edition of Idol
will debut a few weeks later in January of 2012. That will be the first test of how it does
with X factor having just finished. But for now it's the #1 show in the country. Onmomentum alone, it will last another three or four years, even if X factor kills it. Plus, withSimon gone, the costs will fall significan tly.
I usually watch this show every season but I threw in the towel after Lilly and Alex got kicked off.Yeah America, let's boot out the two most unique voices in the competitio n during the third week,
shall we? Siobhan and Crystal are decent enough, but the rest of these people are a waste of time.
They should check out the Chris Mann arrangemen t for Kanye's "Heartless ".

I stopped watching Idol 4-5 years ago when it became clear this was a teen popularity contest and
had little to do with actual singing ability and talent. I started watching only to find out what EllenDwould bring to the show. Unfortunat ely not enough to compensate for the judges poor choices of
who gets into the top 24 - the absolutely awful song selection. I'm over 50 and it's painful to watchthese young people singing dusty moldy oldies from washed up pop and rock stars who haven't hada hit in 25 years. The Rolling stones debacle show did it for me. Poor Paige - who I actually think isa great singer as displayed by her farewell song - was laid low by a combinatio n of laryngitis and
poor song choice. The only contestant that is mildly interestin g to me is Siobhan Magnus. As far as the vocals of
Michael Lynche that everyone goes on about - I think again people are voting for personalit y. I've
heard a lot better in any gospel choir in the country. For me...the show isn't even worth DVRing
anymore. Bye again Idol.
Timjaya will be around as long as those young twits keep twitting.
you are right ken, this seasons contestant s are not very good. i never heard so many bad vocals
and poor songs choices. Siobhan is by far the most interestin g. she is the only one that is really
pushing herself to grow musically by doing more difficult songs. lynche and crystal are good, but
they are not really growing musically. tim, lee, casey and katie are decent but they need goodmentoring to bust out of their shells and do something exciting.
Interestin g order you pick there. My take is:
Didi has a limited range and almost seems to be straining at times.
Lee has some pitch problems now and then and just looks so stressed all the time--hard to watch.Arron is a sweet singer but not powerful enough
Top 4:
CrystalSiobhanMichaelCasey
and not necessaril y in that order. Just IMO. But what do I know? I don't even bother to vote!
After those performanc es, I'd say that Tim and Andrew should be next to go unless they can pull
out a perfect, killer performanc e. But don't go to sleep on Michale Lynche. This guy has one of the
best voices in the group. If he can get some coaching on his stage presence and choreograp hy, he
can be a star something along the lines of a Luther Vandross. (Of course, there is and always will
be only one LVD!) 
Mike will have a recording career--wi n or lose AI.FOLLOW HUFFINGTON POSTPermalink  | Share it

I like Michael a lot and have been using the LVD comparison since his audition.
He will lose, eventually , to Chrystal, who is the only spectacula r talent this season - she
could win any of the previous seasons with the possible exception of David/Davi d season.
Same songs, same comments, same contestant s. No thanks, Fox. I'll watch Rachel and Keith.
Poor Andrew, he's been off the rails since Hollywood week. Paige was the right one to get the bootlast night, I don't know what happend to her but she was DREADFUL, poor Phil Collins must havebeen screaming in anguish as she croaked her way through his song and why did the attribute thesong to Mariah Carey???!!
Unfortunat ely, I think the majority of the group stinks.The y have no idea how to pick a song ( who
keeps co-signing Andrews choice of tuneless, repetitive ditties), virtually no stage presence or they
sound like live-stock being led to slaughter. UGH!! Siohbhan, dear, please don't add a mindlessshriek to the end of every song, it was great once, now it's tiresome. Crystal, put down guitar andput a little life into your performanc es, you have a great voice, but you always look like you're about
to be excuted. Micheal, less lounge lizzard, better song choices. Casey, your cute, lucky you. The
rest of them just stink, really, really stink.
Paige gave the two worst performanc es I have ever seen in the history of American Idol. I'm glad
she's finally gone. This is the most awkward season, the judges just seem so worthless. I love Didi
and her unique sound (plus she is beautiful) and Kara keeps trying to tell her who she thinks she is.I think Didi knows better than Kara does who she is!I can't wait to see Crystal do an R&B song. That should be interestin g. I hope they quit doing songs
from the 70's and do something recent. Andrew has a chance to pull out of his funk here. I think heshould do 'Caught Up' by Usher or would love to hear him or Big Mike sing 'Down' by Jay Sean.Simon keeps telling everyone to make themselves relevant, hopefully they listen and pick somemodern songs.
You have a short memory. MOST of the contestant s on season 1 couldn't hold a candle to
the worst singers in this latest group.
I think Andrew should just sing "Straight Up" every show from here on out, because no matter whathe does, the judges bring it up and throw it in his face.lesterbud    11:09 AM on 3/26/2010

59 Fansi have been watching idol since '03. this year is awful on so many levels that watching it has turned
into a waste of time for me. i sadly took it off the DVR after tuesday's show. goodbye idol. we've hada lot of fun together. i wish you the best.
Did Miley Cyrus help Paige go home by telling her to sing softly? Or was Paige singling softly and
Miley was diplomatic ally compliment ing her? Either way Paige's performanc e was horrible. And as
for mentoring, Miley came off as "Nice" but a lot of her advice was about engaging a concertaudience, not about sounding good and engaging the Cameras. They need mentors with betterexperience who are not afriad to offer concrete suggestion s. Shockingly enough one of the better
mentors I've seen was "Lulu"
Well, relying on the musical advice of a 17 year old might not necessaril y be such a good
idea. Miley is definitely very talented and knows what works for her. She is a huge success,to her credit and Disney's but does she have the range and depth of experience yet to bein the position to technicall y advise other singers? Not so sure.
But, having said that, Paige just has a perpetual pitch problem and no matter how muchtalent and potential a person may have, if you can't sing with perfect pitch in a performance, you will not get very far. There are just too many good singers out there who can andthey are competing to make it, too.
Re Lee Dewyze's cover of "The Letter": Tip of hat to The Box Tops was nice, especially the AlexChilton reference. However, Lee was clearly, one hundred percent, doing Joe Cocker's version ofthe song; a complete reworking of the tune as arranged by Leon Russell for the Mad Dogs &Englishmen tour (went Top 10 on Billboard, but not to No.1). Also, if we're bringing up Alex Chiltonmight be worthwhile to mention that he died just last week at age 59. Big Star is essential listening
for all "power-pop " music fans.
You're right of course about that being the Joe Cocker arrangemen t and the sad news
about Chilton. Happily Big Star's music will love forever.
