            <p>W E D N E S D AY,  J A N U A RY  0 2 ,  2 0 0 8Is "The Golden Compass" Franchise Alive?"The Golden Compass" is doing gangbusters overseas. In the US, itsalmost done at $60 mil. But overseas it has grossed three times that($187 mil) and looks easily headed towards $250 mil. That would meanmore than $300 mil worldwide. Not great for a movie that cost $200mil, but not awful either. Recently, dragon flick Eragon (itself based ona quartet of books) grossed a disappointing $75 mil in the US butanother $175 mil overseas (its budget was about $100 mil) makingwhat looked like a flop opener the first in a franchise. And of courseDVD sales are extremely strong in the fantasy category. So the weakopening of the film meant New Line panicked and finally made nicewith Peter Jackson so "The Hobbit" could go forward. But with hugeoverseas grosses and the possibility that some of the production costfor the sequels will be lower because of all the money poured into thefirst one, there's still a chance they could roll the dice and make bothparts two and three at the same time. Two stumbling blocks remain:will Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig want massive paydays for an iffyfranchise and of course the biggest problem of all is that parts two andthree are a LOT more controversial. It may just not be worth thebother, but with $300 mil box office worldwide and another $200 to$300 mil worldwide from DVD (very conservatively), it won't bebecause they lost money.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT

Anonymous said...Do you realize that New Line sold the overseas rights to help financethis movie? If New Lines sees anything of that overseas money, it willbe minimal. The director himself said the budget went to $250 million.Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
