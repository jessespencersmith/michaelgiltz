Sheila Johnson and Judge William T. Newman Jr. THINK PINK: October is 
breast cancer awareness 
month, and for many 
women, it is the time when 
the pink ribbon is a wardrobe 
staple. Invented in 1991 by 
Evelyn H. Lauder, founder 
and president of the Breast 
Cancer Research Foundation, 
and Alexandra Penney, then-D.C. DOINGS: Even though 
the scope of Sheila Johnson's 
business and humanitarian 
endeavors is admirably large, 
the Washington International 
Horse Show, of which she is 
the president, must surely 
have a very special place in 
her heart. 
It was there, three years 
ago, that she and Judge 
William T. Newman Jr. were 
falling in love. As Johnson 
enjoys recounting, it was just 
weeks after Newman had 
presided over her divorce 
from Robert 1. Johnson, 
with whom she had built 
Black Entertainment Televi­
sion into a formidable media 
giant. Johnson and New­
man's lovely and lavish wed-ding was held at her 200-acre 
property, Salamander Farm, 
in The Plains, Virginia, in late 
September. Next up for the 
happy couple is the 2005 
Washington International 
Horse Show, one of the 
country's most prestigious 
and competitive equestrian 
events. As president and 
managing partner of the 
WNBA's Washington Mystics 
basketball team, Johnson has 
arranged for a "Mystics Fam­
ily Fun Day Performance" 
that promises to bring all the 
energy of a WNBA game to 
the horse enthusiasts in at­
tendance. Salamander Mar­
ket, Johnson's highly success­
ful artisan food marketplace 
located in Middleburg, is the Cartier Roadster Watch 
SHOW CIRCUIT ® FAlL 2005 editor of Self magazine, the 
ribbon is the symbol for 
awareness of the disease and, 
in the words of Lauder, "the 
sisterhood that will help 
women survive and conquer 
it." The esteemed house of 
Cartier takes the accessory­
as-statement a giant step for­
ward with the creation of a 
new version of the Cartier 
Roadster Watch. Made of 
stainless steel and featuring a 
pink dial accented with subtle 
pink ribbons, this limited edi­
tion Roadster is sure to be­
come an instant classic. The 
watch was specially designed 
to benefit the Breast Cancer 
Research Foundation and will 
be available in October at 
Cartier boutiques and autho­
rized dealers nationwide for 
$3,800. For further informa­
tion, visit www.cartier.com 
or call 800-CARTIER. 
HELPING HANDS: For those 
in the mood to raise money 
and have fun at the same 
time, the Equestrian AIDS 
Foundation will hold its third 
annual fundraiser on Thurs­
day, November 10, at 6:30 
P.M. in Los Angeles at Amici 
Brentwood. Featuring in­
credible auction items such 
as phenomenal VIP packages 
to American Idol tapings and 
the Billboard Music Awards, 
proceeds will benefit EAF 
and those affected by the re­
cent hurricanes. For further 
information call 800-792-
6068. Looking ahead, Show 
Circuit hears that some of 
our aware young riders are 
joining "The Ride for Hope;' 
a youth effort that is being</p>
<p>spearheaded by Brianne 
Goutal and Carolyn Kelley. 
More on this in our Winter 
issue. 
CHAPOT HANGS UP HIS 
CHAPEAU: The horsing 
world bid a fond farewell to 
the beloved US Equestrian 
Team coach and show jump­
ing chef d' equipe Frank 
Chapot at a competition in 
Monmouth County, New Jer­
sey. After 25 years with the 
USET, Chapot bid adieu to 
his formal role in a sport he 
loves so well. Chapot com­
peted in numerous Olympics 
(peaking with five consecu­
tive appearances) and used 
that invaluable experience to 
lead teams he coached to . 
achieve excellence, exempli­
fied by nine Olympic medals 
(most recently a silver at 
Athens) and nine Pan Ameri­
can Game medals (including 
the team gold at the 2003 Pan 
Am Games). The USET 
Foundation appropriately 
named Chapot a recipient of 
its Lifetime Achievement 
Award in 2001. Chapot's 
legacy will live on, of course. 
At the very event where he 
made a public farewell, 
Chapot's daughter Laura won the Grand Prix with 
Sprite and a few hours later 
took second with Samantha. 
Hats off to them both! 
MORE MARGIE: Margie 
Goldstein has an unparal­
leled record as a show 
jumper: AGA Rider of the 
Year numerous times, the 
most grand prix wins in his­
tory and all-time money 
winner. Now we heard that 
her mother Mona's self-pub­
lished biography of her 
daughter-No Hurdle Too 
High-has been reissued by a 
major publishing house 
(Lyons Press) in a new ex-
No Hurdle Too High panded hardcover edition for 
$24.95. Along with continu-
ing the story of Margie's ca-
reer from 2001 (when the 
first edition came out) to the 
present, the book has beefed 
up information on the tech-
niques and skills that made 
her a champion. Mona is also 
thrilled about a three-book 
deal she has signed to write 
historical fiction for kids. 
Linda Eder 
HIT SINGER HITS THE ROAD: 
Broadway star Linda Eder is 
famous for her devoted fans 
and performances in hit mu-
sicals like Jekyll & Hyde. Less-
known, however, is that she is 
also a passionate equestrian. 
Eder will celebrate that pas-
sion with Trail MIX, a new 
show debuting on Animal 
Planet in January. Eder will 
travel the world to talk with 
all sorts of artists and hear 
their stories of how com-
muning with horses is a con-
stant source of creativity for 
them. Eder's profile should 
be higher than ever when the 
special airs, given that the 
broadcast follows the Octo-
ber release of By Myself The 
Music of Judy Garland on 
Angel Records. 
SHOW CIRCUIT @ FALL 2005 DISCOVER THIS: Noticing far 
more film cameras and cam-
era crews at Indoors and other 
major shows this season? 
That's because not one but

rently in the works to depict 
life on the Junior hunter/ 
jumper circuit. Among the ac-
complished young riders to be 
featured are Brianne Goutal, 
Maggie McAlary, Paige Beal 
Andros, and Nicoletta Hei-
degger.

cilities, pasture space or vet-
erinary supplies to join them 
in responding to the needs of

In the Bureau of Land 
Management's ongoing effort 
to find good homes for the 
approximately 10,000 wild 
horses removed annually 
from public lands, the federal 
agency has stepped up the 
number of adoption oppor-
tunities. Eight adoptions 
have been slated for Novem-
ber and December. Qualified

Mustang for $125. Owner-
ship criteria include proof of 
adequate shelter and means 
to care for the horse. The ani-
mals are available for ad-
o 
vance viewing, and all have n: 
undergone a veterinary ~ 
~ 
exam, vaccinations, deworm-~. 
~ ing, and blood tests. For
