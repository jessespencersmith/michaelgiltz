The scoop: Tony was very busy last season -he 
chopped up capo Ralphie (Joe Pantoliano) into 
little pieces, felt a little guilty when a former 
girlfriend, Gloria Trillo, committed suicide, 
pOlitely convinced his heir-apparent Christopher 
Moltisanti to go into rehab ("Anybody else 
would've ilad thelr .. .Interventlon right through

Dr. Melfi he'd had enough of the tal]cing cure. He

TIle scoop: JanIce has to t!a~e a man in her life -even

very long: So when lumpy Bobby was widowed. Janice 
swooped in, headed off all the competition from other 
women, badgered and cajoled him inta sucking It UP 
and moving On. It's been almost 15 months since that 
wall-shaking, Emmy-winning Season 4 
finale of "The Sopranos" -where Tony 
(James GandolfinD and Carmela (Edie 
Falco) almost came to blows i.n one of 
the most dramatic wall-punching 
domestic disputes on TV. And even 
devoted viewers could use a reminder 
of where we left off. 
Fifteen months haven't passed on the 
show -it's probably more like six -
but some things haven't changed: the 
season debut tonight at 9 on HBO 
makes clear what's important: family. 
Tony's personal family is splintering 
apart. He and Carmela have fallen into a 
routine of bickering unease, Tony is liv­
ing in bachelor·pad squalor -but still 
drops in on Carmela to leave a monthly 
allowance and to fight over money. 
Tony wants to work out a separation 
arrangement without the help of 
lawyers, but apparently Carmela has 
already spoken with an attorney. 
While Tony's married life is falling 
apart -his sister Janice (Aida Turtur­
ro) has jumped right back into wedded 
bliss, marrying the just-widowed Bobby 
Bacala (Steve Schirripa). 
But just as one family is getting small­
er, Tony's business "family" is growing 
uncomfortably large. And it's his mob 
family that looks to be the source of 
even more heartburn for the lumbering 
crime boss. 
Tony is seen watching the local news, 
where reporters and news pundits 
mouth off on the release of Mafia fig­
ures who've been in jail for decades -
otherwise known as "the class of 2004." 
They happily predict it could mark 
heightened tensions and internal vio­
lence for the mob. 
Among the parolees are Robert Log­
gia as the violent Feech; Joe Santos 
(Detective Becker of "The Rockford 
Files"); and wisecracking Steve Busce­
mi as Tony's cousin and childhood best 
friend who wants to go straight and 
become a licensed massage therapist , 
If all these problems are bugging 
Tony, they're not half as troublesome as 
the "bugs" he barely suspects, The feds 
are all over the place. listening in on 
conversations, turning weak underlings 
into informants and building up a case 
of massive circumstantial evidence that 
they hope will bring his entire world 
crashing down; 
The new season brings back old 
themes -Christopher (Michael Imperi­
oli) whines about not getting respect, 
Paulie (Tony Sirico) seems increasingly 
unhappy and Uncle Junior (Dominic Chi­
anese) increasingly unstable. Adriana 
starts to crack under the intense pressure 
over her status as a stool pigeon. 
And is that Tony watching scenes 
from Barbra Streisand's "The Prince of 
Tides" and quoting Dr. Phil? Something 
is rotten in Jersey and it's starting to 
take its toll. 13

The scoop: Johnny Sack played a 
dangerous game by urging Tony to

designer clothes -and he loves buying them for her. They've also 
supported each other in the past -she encouraged his interest in 
film and he bought her a nightclub. .</p>
