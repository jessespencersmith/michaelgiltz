8/10/2005 03:49:00 PMI don't know how I missed this. But apparently Catholic leadersin Canada are angry that the country won't adapt its ownreligious precepts as the law of the land and keep gays andlesbians as second class citizens. So what do they do? Threatento refuse to baptize babies with gay and lesbian parents. That'sright, Cardinal Quellet promises to deny baptism to an innocentbaby because he thinks the parents are evil. The Advocate hasan impassioned essay on this. As the writer puts it, the childrenof murderers can be baptized. The children of rapists can bebaptized. The children of child molesters can be baptized. Butthe children of gays and lesbians? No. After Cardinal Quellethas read that essay, he might want to reflect on this passage:"The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear theiniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquityof the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be uponhim, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him."-- Ezekiel 18:20 (KJV)
