8/20/2004 05:59:00 AMYep, that fishy case of state law enforcement officials questioningelderly black residents of Orlando who help organize get-out-the-votedrives (all chosen at random, mind you) is officially a scandal. Stateofficials tried to claim they were investigating a case of voter fraud.But the Florida Department of Law found the allegations had no basisback in May, according to Bob Herbert of the NYT. This scandal andthe overall scandal of voting conditions in Florida needs to get on thefront page immediately. Voters in the state should be deluging theirelected officials/staging protests/you name it unless they are willingto see yet another Florida election end in disarray and accusations offraud.
