forced to commit aU those atrocities?" 
Hounsou's "Blood Diamond" 
character, Solomon Vandy, wrestles 
with exactly that dilemma in the film. 
Estranged from his family and forced 
to mine the land for rebels, he finds a 
rare pink diamond and, instinctiv ely, 
hides it. Upon learning of the rock's 
existence , cynical arms dealer Dan-
ny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) latch­
es onto Vandy, looking for a way out of 
Africa. (Jennifer Connelly plays the ca­
sually gorgeous journalist who wants to 
tell Vandy's story,) Yet all Vandy wants 
is to find his family and rescue his little 
boy from the rebels, who've brutalized BY MICHAEL HILTZ 
YOU might think that Djimon 
Hounsou would get tired of 
portraying characters so noble, 
even the young Sidney Poitier 
might've hesitated to play them. 
Hounsou's been a noble slave in "Amistad," a 
noble warrior opposite Russell Crowe in "Gladi· 
ator," another noble warrior opposite Heath 
Ledger in "Four Feathers" and a noble 
(lrtist suffering from AIDS in "In Amer­
ica." Now he's a noble father caught 
up in a civil war, and up against a 
soldier of fortune's greed, in "Blood 
Diamond," opening Friday. 
But when the discussion turns to 
the film's many pressing social is· 
sues -the diamond industry has even 
launched a PR campaign to try to can· 
vince the world it's already ended the trade 
in "conflict" diamonds -Hounsou happily sets 
aside talk of his character and the movie to discuss 
what really matters to him. . , . 
"This is one of the most profound human stones 
coming out of Africa for me personally ." says the 42·. 
year· old actor, who hails from Benin, in Western Afn· 
ca. "It's not just about diamonds. It's about human ref­
ugees and the child soldiers. And it speaks loudly about the corruption, how these countries get exploited. 
the child and turned him into a killer. 
Perhaps Hounsou is driven to tell 
stories about the less fortunate because 
his Own tale is so remarkable . When he 
was 13, Hounsou fled with his brother 
to Paris, where they lived on the streets 
until the designer Thierry Mugler dis­
covered him and put Hounsou on the 
runway. Soon he was appearing in a 
Janet Jackson video, which led to a role 
in the 1994 Kurt Russell·James Spader 
scioli action flick "Stargate." 
That led to Steven Spielberg's 
"Amistad" in 1997, and critics singled 
out Hounsou 's portrayal of Cinque, an 
African put on trial for leading a bloody 
revolt on a slave ship in 1842, as one "After that's over and the country goes into rec­
onciliation or peace Or whatever you want to call it, 
what do you do with those kids? What does the 
of the historically based drama's better 
aspects. A six-episode arc on "ER" fol­
lowed, and he was Oscar-nominated for 
Best Supporting Actor for his role as an 
AfDS-stricken Hell's Kitchen denizen in 
the 2002 immigrant tale "In America." 
But after all of these noble roles, 
Hounsou -who also co-stars in the fan­
tasy adventure "Eragon," out Dec. 15-
says that if he were to do a comedy, it 
would be fine with him. "I'd love to do 
a comedy," he says, before confessing, 4 •• ". I , 
"But I'm not a funny guy. Maybe I'm too 
big for comedy." 
He has had fun with lighrer roles, 
such as a witch doctor of sorts called 
Papa Midnite in the Keanu Reeves 
movie "Constantine" and a sexy repair. 
man in Queen Latifah's "Beauty Shop." 
Where was the pain, where was the 
suffering, in "Beauty Shop"? 
"I did feel guilty," laughs Hounsou, 
"because I didn't feel like I was really 
doing a film'" •</p>
