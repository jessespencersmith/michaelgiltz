10/28/2004 11:05:00 PMBush is lining up support all over the world. He's got the endorsementof the Iranian theocracy, the Islamic terrorists in Spain, andpresumably the freedom-lovers in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, two ofour biggest allies/enemies in the war on terror.But oddly, the people he's spent $200 billion (and counting) and morethan a thousand dead US soldiers to free don't want him reelected.Surely if Bush could expect the support of ANYONE in the world itshould have been the Iraqis right?But USA Today says a new poll of Iraqis shows most don't care whowins the US presidential election and of those that do, it's about 56%for Kerry vs. 40% for Bush. Here's hoping folks here in the USA votethe same way.
