6/28/2005 02:00:00 PMBrace yourselves for a cold winter, especially if you're poor.USA Today reports that heating oil prices are up more than60% from a year ago. Bills won't go up that much, but they willgo up. Lat year, average heating oil bills increased almost 30%.Almost ten percent of all homes are warmed with heating oil,but they're located mostly in the liberal bastion of theNortheast, so who cares? The hardest hit will be the poor andelderly, of course. Hey President Bush, if the elderly freeze todeath, can we use them as tinder for our fires? That would helpthe Social Security plan as well, wouldn't it? Don't ever sayBush isn't thinking ahead.Meanwhile, the Senate has passed the same old energy bill italways passes -- a few bones tossed for those who think weshould launch a Manhattan Project to develop alternativeenergy, a refusal to take the quickest and most effective steps(like insisting on modest increase in fuel efficiency forautomobiles) and the insistence that energy plants use "more"renewable fuels to generate electricity. (Naturally the WhiteHouse objects to that.) And they tossed in partial immunity forbig businesses that are responsible for polluting ourgroundwater all over the country. The House bill is even worse.And in possible good news for our children's children, 30nations have come together to start building the world's firstnuclear fusion reactor in France. Greenpeace, rather foolishly,objects, says the NYT.Environmental campaign group Greenpeace estimates thatif the project yields any results at all, it will not be until thesecond half of this century.``At a time when it is universally recognized that wemust reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,Greenpeace considers it ridiculous to use resourcesand billions of euros on this project,'' it said.It will take decades and may not even work, but it's exactly the sortof long-range thinking that has to take place if the world is to solveits hunger for energy. And working on a fusion reactor doesn't meanyou can't also tackle greenhouse gases.
