9/13/2005 01:30:00 PMThe morning session of Roberts' confirmation hearing is over.Sen. Kennedy failed to land any blows and looked less-than-effective by asking lengthy questions and interrupting Robertsbefore the nominee could get two words out. Sen. Biden did alittle better by mocking Roberts' assertion that his memos justreflect the opinion of his bosses. As Biden points out, Robertsin one memo writes "...and I strongly agree," making theobvious point that this sure SOUNDS like a staffer's personalopinion. Roberts danced away. But one interesting point:The White House has trumpeted the tens of thousands ofdocuments released from Roberts' work in the Reaganadministration and elsewhere as proof of how thoroughlyvetted this nominee is. But Roberts has repeatedly made clearhe believes we can draw ZERO assumptions about his personalviews from any of it. No matter how passionately he may arguean issue or urge a stance in private memos, Roberts insiststhose statements merely reflect the position of his bosses thathe was hired to work for and not necessarily his own.In short, since Roberts says we have to ignore virtually all ofthe 50,000+ pages of documents as revealing nothing abouthim and since his judicial career is extremely short, we arebeing asked to nominate someone that we know virtuallynothing about. That should make EVERYONE uneasy (includingthe far right) so why is the left the only side that thinks weshould know SOMETHING about what a nominee for theSupreme Court believes in?
