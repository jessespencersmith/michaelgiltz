GEORGINA BLOOMBERG-ELEGANT 
APPEAL: New York City Mayor Mike 
Bloomberg may have fallen short in 
bringing the Olympics to the Big Apple 
in 2012, but his daughter Georgina 
shows no sign of faltering in her bid to 
become a top international equestrian. 
Georgina's latest triumph? Shewon the 
prestigious Longines Prize for Elegance 
while riding Riviera during the Nations 
Cup in La Baule, France. As one mem­
ber of the jury put it, "Despite an initial 
error during her second Nations Cup 
round, Georgina did not flinch but rode 
bravely on right to the end." Bloomberg 
received roughly $11,000 and a set of 
beautiful Longines watches, along with 
points contributing to her quest for this 
accolade at the end of the season. (It cli­
maxes during the CSIO in Barcelona.) 
Among Bloomberg's many accomplish­
ments in her young career was a flawless 
performance during the Super League's 
Nations Cup, helping her team to a first­
place victory.

OSCAR BUZZ BUILDING: Hollywood has 
always loved horses-the Western 
Cimarron won just the fourth Best Pic­
ture Oscar way back in 1931, and recent By Michael Giltz 
winners include Dances with Wolves and 
Unforgiven. This year looks just as 
promising, with Ang Lee's cowboy movie 
Brokeback Mountain an end-of-the-year 
hopeful. Yet the strongest showing may 
come from Show Circuit favorite Tommy 
Lee Jones with his feature directorial 
debut, The Three Burials of Melquiades 
Estrada. Starring Barry Pepper (of 
HBO's 61 *), country singer Dwight 
Yoakam and Levon Helm of The Band 
(not to mention Jones himself), the 
movie garnered roars of approval at this 
summer's Cannes Film Festival, where 
Jones was named Best Director and Best 
Actor, and the film won Best Screenplay. 
Oscar insider Tom O'Neill has said Three 
Burials has "a serious shot at being that 
little arty movie that often sneaks into 
the top 5."Watch for this moving, uncon­
ventional drama to open in theaters to­
ward the end of the year. 
SHOW CIRCUIT ® SUMMER 2005 COPPERFIELDS SADDLES UP: The 
New York City institution Copper­
fields-located on 24th Street and 
beloved by equestrians everywhere-has 
been renamed Manhattan Saddlery and 
is under new management. Loyal cus­
tomers needn't fret, however. The store 
is now being overseen by Joseph Der, 
who will serve as president and designer 
while still heading up his family-owned 
Der Dau, the famed maker of hand­
crafted custom boots and shoes for 
more than 50 years. Der promises to 
maintain the high standards people de­
pended on at Copperfields, with some 
promising new offerings-including an 
in-house tailor and private shopper. 
''I'm going to be designing my own 
equestrian fashions and town and coun­
try fashions;' reports Der, who is busy 
overseeing details such as a new website 
and the fashion introductions in time 
for the official reopening in November. 
(The store remains open while these 
changes are afoot.) Saddles from France 
and England, exclusive products, you 
name it-as Der says, "If they're looking 
for something they can't find anywhere 
else, we can provide it." Der is so excited 
about the opportunity to extend his 
family's well-earned reputation for ex­
cellent footwear into clothing that he 
has only one regret: "1 wish I could open 
up sooner!"

LIONEL GUERRAND-HERMES TROPHY 
GOES TO BRIANNE GOUTAL: For more 
than 20 years, the Lionel Guerrand-Her­
mes trophy presented by the United 
States Equestrian Team has celebrated 
the talents of a promising Junior/Young 
rider destined for success. This year's re­
cipient combining horsemanship with 
good sportsmanship is 16-year-old New 
Yorker Brianne Goutal, who was hon­
ored with the trophy during the FEI 
Budweiser World Cup in Las Vegas. The 
future Olympic hopeful was wowed by 
the Guerrand-Hermes Trophy, not to 
mention the crowd of tens of thousands 
who watched the presentation. "So 
many great riders got this before me, 
whether it was an eventer or dressage 
rider," Goutal expressed afterwards. ''I'm 
just really excited and honored:'Goutal's 
accomplishments in the hunter/jumper 
discipline and horsemanship are le­
gion-she was named the Junior 
Jumper Circuit Champion in 2004, the 
same year Goutal won the WEF Equi­
tation Championship. 
ROUNDING UP MR. ROMANCE: Every 
female horse lover knows that Mr. Right 
has to be right at home in the saddle. 
Season two of The Oxygen Network's 
reality-comedy show puts that principle 
to the test. They're searching for men 
(age 21-45) who can play polo, jump 
horses, or rope steer. In addition, appli­
cants must be "attractive, outgoing, charming, energetic, in great physical 
shape, comfortable on camera, and pos­
sess a healthy level of competitiveness:' 
(Gee, is that all?) Men passing their in­
terview will attend a Romance Academy 
to learn how to woo women-though 
presumably someone who is "attractive, 
outgoing, charming, energetic, in great 
physical shape" and so on wouldn't need 
that many lessons. Make the top ten of 
your class and you'll be part of the tele­
vised contest whose winner gets $50,000 
and a role in an Oxygen original movie. 
Act fast: The auditions close for good on 
August 19. Call 323-468-2031 for more 
information. 
Mr. Romance is looking for a 
few good (equestrian) men.

How about 'YSchuyler Riley? She did it 
again! She won the Chrysler Cup two 
years in a row, which has never been 
done by an American or a woman be­
fore! It is also the first time anyone has 
captured it back to back since Ian Mil­
lar won in 1986-89, when it was held 
atThe National. In the 15 years that 
the Chrysler Cup has been held at the 
North American, there have only been 
nine clear rounds, and Schuyler has 
two of them! Congrats to Schuyler and 
her winning ways! 
Stay tuned, everyone. HorseTV Media 
Group,lnc. announced recently that it 
has launched The Horse Channel 
from its new corporate headquarters 
in Calabasas, California. The 18,000-
plus-square-foot complex will also 
house the company's television pro­
duction and post-production facilities. 
The is another example of the expand­
ing interest in the equestrian scene. 
Airing date is scheduled for this fall 
and will be on the air 24/7. Check 
their website horsetv.com for more in­
formation. Good luck guys; we are all 
rooting for you, as this type of eques­
trian TV coverage is long overdue! 
Sean Patrick Maloney, who is run­
ning for attorney general of New Jer­
sey, and his partner, Randy Florke, 
invited a few of the horsey elite and 
fashion set to their benefit event at 
the private residence of DF/music

HALL OF FAMER: Three-time Olympian 
Kathy Kusner continues to blaze new 
trails with her recent induction into the 
World Sports Humanitarian Hall of 
Fame. The silver medalist show jumper 
at the '72 Olympics (not to mention the 
first licensed female jockey in U.S. histo­
ry) is now recognized for her many ac­
complishments off the sporting stage as 
well. Kusner's Horses in the Hood pro­
gram has bettered the lives of hundreds 
of at-risk youth in South Central Los 
Angeles, teaching them the joys and re­
sponsibilities of caring for and riding 
horses. That program is a key reason 
Kusner was honored recently with her 
induction at Boise State University. Join­
ing the likes of Arthur Ashe, Jackie 
Robinson, and Pete, Kusner said, "I 
don't need to tell you that the World 
Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame is as 
good as it gets. I cannot thank you 
enough:' Find out more about her work 
at www.horsesinthehood.org. 
SAFETY PATROL: Starting on December 
1, tough new rules will ensure that safe­
ty comes first for all competitors jump­
ing over fences. Securely fastened pro­
tective headgear that meets or exceeds 
ASTM/SE1 standards will be required­
even in warm-up rings-for juniors and 
seniors. These criteria apply to Hunter, Jumper, and Hunt Seat Equitation class­
es, both open and breed restricted in­
cluding Hunter Hack, where jumping is 
required, and anywhere on the competi­
tion grounds. The Board of Directors of 
the United States Equestrian Federation 
unanimously approved this rule change 
after extensive testimony documenting 
the dramatic protection headgear can 
provide during an accident. As Andrew 
Ellis, chairman of the USEF Safety 
Committee put it, "An ASTM/SE1 ap­
proved helmet cannot totally prevent an 
injury, but it certainly can help manage 
the risk." 
HUNTER BOOTS MAKE JUMP TO 
AMERICA: Following on the heels of 
such well-known British designers as 
Stella McCartney and Alexander Mc­
Queen, the venerable British bootmaker 
Hunter has made the leap across the 
pond and is offering its footwear in the 
"colonies" for the first time. Long a fa­
vorite with European riders, Hunter's 
equestrian boot collection includes 
three styles designed for use in the pad­
dock and stable as well as on horseback. 
The riding boot collection includes the 
Masselburgh, a zip-fronted ankle jodh­
pur boot for men and women ($149); 
the Kelso, a women's ankle-high pad­
dock boot with laced front ($169); and 
the Hamilton, a women's knee-high de­
sign featuring side zip and buckle 
($210). All are made of water-resistant,

(CARDINAL) RED HOT STANFORD: The 
Stanford University Equestrian Team is 
planning an unusually big bash for its 
17th annual Red Barn Festival fundrais­
er slated for Saturday, October 8. There 
are a year's worth of major riding facili­
ty renovations to celebrate and already 
some very cool prizes donated for the 
gala's live auction. Hottest items so far 
include the chance to hang out in Eu­
rope with international show jumping 
stars Peter Wylde and Fein Cera, and a 
shot at working with top hunter/jumper 
trainer Missy Clark. The common de­
nominator here is Stanford student 
Sarah Willeman, currently pursuing her 
master's in education. She owns the 
2002 WEG champion horse and is close 
friends with Clark, one of her trainers as 
a top junior. A star of the team's Open English divisions as an undergraduate, 
the delightful Sarah plans to compete in 
Reining for the school this year and to 
continue helping the team by teaching 
riders and schooling horses, two of her 
many passions. -Kim F. Miller 
HALLMARK GOES WILD: Someday soon, 
they might rename the Hallmark Chan­
nel the Horsing Channel, because this 
cable network has proven time and again 
that it comprehends the power and 
beauty of horses and that original 
movies built around these noble animals 
are a sure-fire draw for viewers. The lat­
est proof? Hallmark has just begun pro­
duction on Wild Hearts, an original 
movie starring Richard Thomas of The 
Waltons and Nancy McKeon of The 
Facts of Life and The Division. In it, 
Thomas and his young daughter (Hallee 
Hirsch of the indie film Happy Endings) 
move from Chicago to Montana to care 
for a herd of Mustangs when the little 
girl's grandfather dies. They fall in love 
with the horses and the simplicity of 
small town life (not to mention Thomas 
falling for local McKeon), only to find 
out that developers want to run off the 
horses and construct a mall. Hallmark's 
most recent success in this genre came 
with the Civil War gem The Colt. Anyone 
who saw that knows they'll want to keep 
a sharp eye out for Wild Hearts, too. •
