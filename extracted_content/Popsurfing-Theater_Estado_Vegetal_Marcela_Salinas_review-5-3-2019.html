THEATER: "MANUELA INFANTE," OR
REVENGE OF THE PLANT KINGDOM
ESTADO  VEGETAL  *** out of ****
BARYSHNIKOV  ARTS  CENTER
If monologist Anna Deavere Smith could dance and preferred fiction to
non, she might come up with something like the oddball pleasures ofEstado  Vegetal.  This one person performance piece belongs at the
Baryshnikov Arts Center for two good reasons. First, it was
workshopped at the BAC in 2016. Second, every gesture, every
movement by performer Marcela Salinas has purpose and effect. It's abold, fascinating and slightly nutty work that will reward those ofan...expansive nature when it comes to the arts. This is the sort ofshow that begins simply, with a man answering questions from an
unseen police officer. By the end, actors don ceramic pots, then a giant
plant gets the spotlight along with a microphone while you confidentlywait to hear what it has to say and it seems quite reasonable to do so.
You can think of Estado  Vegetal  in several ways. It's a manifesto for
the plant kingdom, those members of this planet perhaps unfairly
ravaged by homo sapiens.
It's also a one person show where Salinas captivatingly embodies the
members of a neighborhood reeling from a tragic "accident." The
branches of a massive old tree hit some power lines late at night,
plunging their street into darkness just as young fireman Manuelcomes roaring down the road on his motorcycle. Salinas deliversmonologues by a host of people including a city worker in charge ofgreen spaces, a little girl who loves the tree, a busybody sticking her
nose into everyone else's business, the mother of Manuel and more.
And it's also perhaps a mystery of sorts, with the prime suspect hiding
in plain sight and boasting the rock-solid alibi of all arboreal criminals-- trees can't move or think or act. Can they?MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

THEATER: 'BLKS' IS</p>
<p>Here's a video about the piece when it was being developed at BAC in
2016. Needless to say, elements may have changed since then, but it
nicely captures the artists and their creative processes.
Estado  Vegetal  is admirable and fun to watch, especially in the strong
earlier half where one character after another comes to life through a
combination of dialogue, movement, lighting and playful props. Thepiece was created by both director Manuela Infante and star Salinas,
assisted strongly by the set, costume and lighting of Rocio Hernández.
I see no credit for sound design but voice recording was done by Poldel Sur and sound is a major player in the show's effect, with a loopingdevice giving Salinas the freedom to "interview" herself as well as
create aural collages that do everything from mirror the crosstalk of
two humans to encompassing a roaring inferno.
However, Estado  Vegetal  is also an intense work of movement and
sound that demands close attention. Pieces like this are hard to
maintain for an hour; Estado  Vegetal  runs an unwise 90 minutes.
Worse, it builds to a climactic moment in which the plants of the
world finally give voice to their demands. (From the sound of it,humans are in for a world of hurt.) The scene is effective and sofreighted with grand finale symbolism (a fog machine, a sound collage
that builds and builds in cataclysmic power, lighting that glows with
doom and then fades to black, etc.) I naturally assumed we hadreached the end.
But no, a substantial portion of the show remained. That portion is
fascinating in its own right. Yet it feels extraneous; intellectually I
understand it's not, but still.... Worse the plotting is more ellipticaland vague than the relatively easy to follow chorus of voices thatpreceded it. Yes, it all ties together (even a detour into the gothic) andthe philosophical ideas embodied in a flashback with Manuel give
firmer voice to the show's intentions. Nonetheless, one felt impatient
towards the end, an unhappy response to a work made withintelligence and passion. After all, many people talk to their plants.But very few listen for a response.SERIOUSLY FUNNY

<p>NOTE: This piece has just one more performance in NYC on May 3.
But co-writer/director Manuela Infante is a major talent to keep aneye out for when she returns to the city. And those interested in gettinga new perspective on plants might enjoy the delightful work of popularscience
