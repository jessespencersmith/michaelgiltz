BRlDGll,lG WRtDS
hen actor I(aI Penn Qately of
Fox's "24") read Pulitzer Prize-
winner Jhumpa Lahiri's 2004
best-selling novel "The Name-
sake," he felt an intense con-
nection with it. Finding out
director Mira Nair ("Mon-
soon Wedding," 'Vanity Faif)ii
was tuming it into a fiIm made him deter-
mined to become involved.
'IMhen I read the book, I identified
with it the same way I identified with 'The
Catcher in the Rye,"' says Penn, 29, who
stars in the film, which opens Friday. "My
characterl Gogol is an American kid of
Indian descent who grows up in Massa-
chusetts - in the film it's switched to New
York - but it wasn't because of a shared
background. He's totally different from
me, but I really idenffied with him and I
really wanted to play the part.
"I was aggressive in finding Mira and
trying to get an appointment to see her."
Happily, Nair's teenage son - a huge
fan of the 2004 comedy hit "Harold &
Kumar Go to White Castle," which Penn
starred in with John Cho - was already
laying the groundwork, urging his mother
to cast the co-star of one his favorite films.
Lr the novel and fiIm, we watch as two
people from Calcutta in an arranged mar-
riage slowly fall in love while dealing with
the challenges of starting a new life in
America - not the least of which is the
undreamed of behavior of their children.
Nai4 the accomplished Indian filmmake4
of course gets every novel with the slight-
est connection to India sent her way, but
this one, she says, was special.iii::-tsi.,:\
SATAAM BOMBAY, AND NEW YORK
Director Mira Nair (standing) with
(from l.) Kal Penn, Tabu and lrfan Khan
tlming'The Namesake,' about Indian
immigrants and their Americanized son.
"I was just possessed by it," says Nair,
who was offered the chance to do a "Har-
ry Potter" film but turned it down to keep
her commitment to "The Namesake."
"Mostly because I-ahiri understood
what it was like [for children of immi-
grantsl to bury a parent in a land that
is not fully home. I was reading it dur-
ing a period of mourning for my mother-
in-law, and when I read this book ... I felt
there was someone there in the world who
knew. There was great solace in it. And
the rest of it is, uncannily, the road I have
traveled myself."
For Lahiri, who lives in New York, Nair
was "the ideal person" to tum the novel
into a movie (she had already turned down
one offer to film it). And khiri certainly
knew that, with the project in Nair's hands,
she wouldn't need to second-guess.
"It was wonderful to be able to hand it
over to her," says Lahiri. "Ijust knew from
our very first meeting that something
really interesting was going to come out
of it all." ,}</p>
