8/26/2005 10:47:00 AMJohn is off to the airport, again, for a family reunion thisweekend. He'll be checking back in a few hours when he lands- in the meantime, I thought I'd put a bit more content up tohold you all over. Enjoy.Novak keeps churning out his column long after he squanderedall his credibility serving as a bag man for Rove and Bush. Hislatest confused rant says that the Dems are playing possum onthe John Roberts nomination (if only!)and that they plan toBork the guy as soon as the hearings begin. Proof positive?Kennedy's "tough guy" sidekick James Flug has returned to hisside. Flug was a Kenndy aide in the 60s, worked on hispresidential run and worked with Kennedy to focus on andblock extreme Republican court nominees from Nixon's days totoday. So what do I know? Maybe Flug coming back is a signKennedy and the Dems are taking the fight about Roberts veryseriously.Then I read the small print and realized that Flug rejoinedKennedy on Capitol Hill MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO! Yep, hisreturn to Kennedy's staff some two years ago -- long beforeanyone had heard of Roberts -- clearly indicates they'regunning for him. What a scoop. And what an embarrassmentNovak is.
