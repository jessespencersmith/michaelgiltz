8/08/2005 12:55:00 PMWell, what a nice quid pro quo. Far right activists pushed Bushto name someone like Kevin Martin to head the FCC. NowMartin has hired far right activist Penny Nance to "advise" himand reach out to Congress and the public. Nance claims to bean "anti-pornography" crusader, but in fact she attacks freespeech and wants to make her interpretation of the Bible thelaw of the land, a la the Taliban. This is indeed like putting thefox in charge of the hen house. First, PBS is put under thethumb of activist Republicans, now our airwaves are put underthe heel of far right fringe activists who want to wrest powerfrom the people and impose their religious beliefs on thecountry.On Penny Nance's resume:*board member of Concerned Women For America -- theirstated goal is "helping...to bring Biblical principles into all levelsof public policy."*founder of Kids First Coalition -- activist group which reprintsRepublican speeches and papers on its website (just what kidslove to read!) and pushing to censor DVDs and end a woman'sright to abortion*attacked basic cable in January -- she sees a "huge indecencyproblem" despite the fact that any and every channel on cablecan be blocked by parents at no charge -- so if all you wantyour kids to watch is The 700 Club, you've got the power rightnow. But Nance knows this. She wants to stop YOU fromwatching what you want, as well. Say goodbye to "The Shield"and "Battlestar Galactica" (Pagan worship) and more if she hasher way.* worked with/for Center for Reclaiming America -- whichwants to "implement the Biblical principles on which ourcountry was founded."The FCC has some 50+ indeceny complaints it may start actingon soon. Nance's hiring seems to indicate Martin wants topoliticize that process and use the platform of the FCC toimpose a narrow, fundamentalist Christian ethos onto theairwaves that are owned by ALL Americans.This is very dangerous. Why in heaven's name would the FCChire an adviser who is a fringe political activist that spends allher time campaigning to influence the FCC? Shouldn't they bethe non-partisan guardian of the airwaves that deals withcomplaints on all sides and try to act judiciously? Ha.Call or email Chairman Kevin J. Martin at the FCC and tell himhow disturbed you are that he would hire a fringe activist thatrepeatedly lobbies the FCC as an adviser. Why doesn't he hirean activist from the other side as well so that ALL Americanscan feel they have a voice in how our airwaves are regulated?Better yet, why doesn't he avoid hiring activists who repeatedlylobby the FCC from ANY side and simply hire non-partisanpeople devoted to the best interests of the public at large, not
