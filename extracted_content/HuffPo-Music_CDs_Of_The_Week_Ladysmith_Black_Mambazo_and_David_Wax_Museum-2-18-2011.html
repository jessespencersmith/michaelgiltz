Album sales may be slower than ever, but there's more
great music out there than ever before -- and you cancheck it out more easily than ever. So every week, I'llshare a favorite new album. Usually, it will be a newrelease or maybe it's just been out for a few weeks or
months and just caught my ear. By the end of the year,
you'll have sampled some of the best albums of the year.Normally, I won't talk about the new Eminem CD; if youcare about that, you know about it already. These aren'treviews so much as recommendations. Think of it as afriend grabbing you and saying, "You've got to hearthis!"
So if you have adventurous ears and like music from all
sorts of genres, keep checking in. This week, I'll start with two albums: one is by a world-class act and the
other is a new talent that's very promising. Enjoy.

<p>LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO  -- SONGS FROM A ZULU FARM.
We've probably been taking this legendary South African act for granted. Like most people, I was
introduced to Ladysmith Black Mambazo  by Paul Simon's landmark Graceland . That led me to the
classic compilation The Indestructible Beat Of Soweto Volume One  and a wealth of great African talent,
foremost among them this brilliant vocal group. I thought I was a fan until I saw them in concert. Onrecord, their voices are beautiful and charming; in concert, the precision, technical mastery andoverwhelming beauty of what they do hits you with full force.
In the wake of Graceland , Ladysmith Black Mambazo signed with Warner Bros. for a while, heard their
songs in movies and TV shows and commercials and became a popular touring act. Eventually, the
spotlight faded a bit and they settled back onto smaller labels. Like some people, I probably felt I had'enough" Ladysmith Black Mambazo albums at some point, as if you could have "enough" jazz or"enough" Rolling Stones. So every once in a while I'd check in when an album seemed especially notable,but not always with the same passion.
Songs From A Zulu Farm  made me a fan all over again. It's a great introduction to new fans and a career
capper for an act that has produced excellent music for decades. The songs are traditionals they learned
growing up in the rural farms of South Africa. "Imithi Gobakahle" calls in the kids from the rain,promising them they can go back outside as soon as it stops. "Ntulube" is a song to sing when you wantto swim in the river -- throw in a stone and if the ripples are clean, it's safe. If not, there might be a snakeor other creature around and the song can chase them away. "Vuka" is a tune to wake up baby chicks inthe morning so they can eat the food you're bringing. There's even a spin on "Old MacDonald." You cango to MySpace and listen to the music on Songs From A Zulu Farm  right now . And here's a recent video
of them in concert also doing one of the tunes. Not great audio but it's always good to glimpse them live.
Their performances are playful and warm -- Ladysmith has always had a flair for performance but rarely

<p>has there been such joy in their recorded work. Animal sounds, giggling children, a celebration of home
life - it all suffuses the album with a sweetness that the band always embraced but that the darkness oflife didn't always allow to shine through completely. If you've never heard them, start here. If you're a fanbut haven't bought an album in a while, don't hesitate. Great stuff.
DAVID WAX MUSEUM  -- EVERYTHING IS SAVED
So for this very first column, I wanted to pair a classic act with a new one that will hopefully be aroundfor a long time to come. Did you see the Grammys? The highlight performance for me was the greatcombination of Mumford & Sons followed by The Avett Brothers and then both bands backing Bob Dylan
on "Maggie's Farm."
Well, David Wax Museum  -- inevitably referred to as an Americana band -- would have fit right in on that
stage. And in their case, the "Americana" label is particularly apt since they drawn on Mexican as well as
US folk tradition for an exuberant, timeless sound that is distinctive but instantly familiar. Like on theirsingle, "Born With A Broken Heart."
It's a great opener and the album  Everything Is Saved  doesn't disappoint. "Yes, Maria, Yes" and
"Chuchumbe" are similarly infectious, while "Si, Te Vas" and "Night Was A Car" have a woozy, fadedglamour. You can go to their website  to find out how David Wax from Missouri and Suz Slezak from
Virginia fell in love with folk music (including styles south of the border) and joined forces to lead DavidWax Museum. You can go to MySpace and check out all the music right now. Sure, any hip band worth its
salt is going to pull out the accordion every once in a while. But how many also boast the quijada, the
jarana and the requinto?
Sometimes it sounds like a front porch sing-along, other times you're in a packed bar downing beers and
every once in a while, they just sound heartbroken enough to be singing alone (the closer "Wait For Me")
