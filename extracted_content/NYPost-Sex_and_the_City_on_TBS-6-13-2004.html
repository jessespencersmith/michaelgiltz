Where's 
the 'Sex'? 
Carrie washes her 
mouth out for TBS 3 
By MICHAEL GILTZ ~I (31 QLf. 
HOW do you turn the R-rated capers 
of Carrie Bradshaw and her pals on 
"Sex and the City" into a syndicated 
hit? Short of excising all scenes with Kim 
Cattrall, you have to leave much of the sex 
and nudity to the imagination. 
Fans can see how the HBO hit was modi­
fied for TBS when the network begins its 
broadcast of the series, which ran for six 
seasons, with a five-night marathon of 10 
episodes starting Tuesday at 10 p.m. 
Viewers who have never seen the show 
will just see a smart, well-acted comedy. 
Compare the original with the TBS edit 
and you'll get some funny insights into

, what's acceptable fare on basic cable. 
On "Ex and the City," the show's second­
season finale, Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) 
explains her panic about seeing Steve. her 
ex-boyfriend, by saying, "The man has 
been inside me, for God's sake." 
TBS toned the scene way down. In its 
version, Miranda merely says, "We've been 
intimate, for gosh sakes." 
In the premiere episode of the third sea­
son, the cuts are just as widespread . In one 
scene, Samantha corrects Miranda, who 
refers to Steve as just a friend. "No, we're 
just friends," Sam says. "I don't put my d--k 
in you." Miranda, who is drinking a Staten

Island Iced Tea, jokes, '\\nother one of 
these and I might let you." 
That scene, along with a notorious, naked 
encounter between Samantha and a fire­
man, are only available on DVD. 
"Drama Queens," from season four, fea­
tures a book called "Marriage, Inc." Sam 
reads out loud, "Chapter One: how to get 
ahead by giving head." In a rare example of 
awkward overdubbing, Cattrall is seen 
mouthing the same line, but heard saying, 
"How to get ahead by putting out." 
People who know their "Sex" won't like 
these changes. But for those who prefer their 
naughty talk a lot less naughty, "No Sex and 
the City" is a bizarre compromise.
