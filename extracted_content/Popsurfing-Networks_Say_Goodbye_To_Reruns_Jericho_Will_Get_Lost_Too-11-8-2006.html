            <p>W E D N E S D AY,  N O V E M B E R  0 8 ,  2 0 0 6Networks Say Goodbye To Reruns -- "Jericho" WillGet Lost, TooWhat you're seeing today is a realization by the major networks thatreruns just aren't going to cut it anymore. They need to develop a wholenew gameplan. People WANT to catch shows they missed -- but they'lldo it via on-demand, iTunes, network websites, their own DVRs, etc.Filling up a third of the season isn't going to work anymore -- and notjust for serialized dramas. Network television is changing dramatically.When FOX can dominate even though its big hits don't begin airing tilJanuary (ie. "24" and "American Idol") everyone else needs to changetoo.CBS has just announced that "Jericho" is going to take a break, ratherthan run a bunch of repeats. Just like "Lost," it's going to air acliffhanger finale -- for "Jericho" on Nov. 29 and then come back with arecap episode on Valentine's Day and an all-new episode on February21. Hey, SciFi does it with "Battlestar: Galactica" by splitting up itsseason with many months in between and I don't squawk about that.HBO doesn't even bother making up full seasons -- they only make 12episodes at a time of "Deadwood, " "The Wire," "The Sopranos," et al.I guess major networks -- with their much bigger resources -- just haveto meet higher standards. The FOX model is the way to go. And guesswhat? That means a LOT more TV shows. If "Lost" only airs originalepisodes, you're going to need another show to fill that slot whether it'shalf in the fall and half in the spring or all at once. I just happen tothink that running them all together in the spring (or fall) will workbetter.And not every show needs to be 22 episodes long. "Kidnapped" wouldhave been a much smarter bet if it was limited to 12 episodes a season.A kidnapping that had a beginning, middle and end in 12 episodeswithout any repeats would have been much more attractive to newviewers. Plus, teasing out a plot for that to 22 episodes just meant youhad to make some ludicrous twists and turns creatively. Shorterseasons for shows where it fits. No reruns. Every episode availableonline with commercials or on iTunes right after it airs. TV has neverchanged so much so fast.Next Blog»sal1mineo@hotmail.comSEARCH BLOG FLAG BLOGFOLLOW BLOGP O P S U R F I N G .
