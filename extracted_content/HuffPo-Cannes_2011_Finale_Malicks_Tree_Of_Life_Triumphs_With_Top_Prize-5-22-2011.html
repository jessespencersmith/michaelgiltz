 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyCannes 2011 Finale: Malick's Tree Of
Life  Triumphs With Top Prize
Director Terrence Malick's The Tree Of Life  won the
Palme d'Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival but of
course the reclusive director did not appear to collect hisprize. It is certainly one of the most popular choices asfar as critics are concerned. The film certainly had itsdetractors of the "Emperor Has no Clothes" variety, butTree of Life  was consistently one of the most highly
praised films according to all the surveys by both theinternational and US press. Check out my four starreview here.
Another director that didn't appear but whose
appearance was surely felt was Lars Von Trier. KirstenDunst won Best Actress for Von Trier's Melancholia  and
though it's undeniably some of her best work on film to date, it's easy to believe the jury wanted to send amessage of support for the art of Von Trier, if not for his lame, awkward Nazi jokes that were turned intoan international incident by a cynical press and then stoked further by the fest's silly and meaningless
decision to declare the director "persona non grata." "What a week it's been," Dunst reportedly said on
accepting the prize.
Other top winners included the Dardenne brothers whose marvelous movie The Kid With A Bike  tied for
runner-up with Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan's Once Upon A Time In Anatolia.

<p>The jury headed by Robert De Niro did a very smart job. Critical favorite The Tree Of Life  got its due.
They also tossed in a little controversy by acknowledging Von Trier via Dunst. Turkis director Ceylan is
the sort of festival favorite who seems destined to win a Palme some day. And they maintained a coolfactor by picking Nicolas Winding Refn for Best Director for Drive .
The French audience was given several reasons to cheer. The Dardennes are always a favorite at Cannes.
Actress Maiwenn broke through as a director with Polisse , which got Third Place. And actor Jean Dujarin
is a very popular star of silly spy films (think Matt Helm), sort of the current Jean Paul Belmondo. Buthe's yet to become an international star. That may change thanks to The Artist , an homage to silent
movies in which he cuts a dashing figure as the most famous actor in the world. Look for him to be in the
running for the Best Actor Oscar thanks to this nod. For a complete winners and all my coverage of thefest, see below.
COMPETITION AWARD WINNERS:
Palme d'Or/Best Film: The Tree Of Life
Grand Prix/Runner-up: The Kid With A Bike/Once Upon A Time In AnatoliaPrix du Jury/Honorable Mention: PolisseBest Actress: Kirsten Dunst for MelancholiaBest Actor: Jean Dujarin for The ArtistPrix de la mise en scene/Best Director: Nicolas Winding Refn for DrivePrix du Scenario/Best Screenplay: Joseph Cedar for Hearat ShulayamCamera d'Or/Best First Film: Pablo Gorgelli for Les AcaciasBest Short Film: Ukranian director Marina Viroda for Cross Country
UN CERTAIN REGARD WINNERS:
Prize of Un Certain Regard: Arirang  and Stopped On Track  (tie)
Special Jury Prize: Elena
Directing Prize: Mohammad Raoulov for Goodbye
I missed Stopped On Track  and Goodbye , the latter of which was admired more for the conditions under
which it was made than the film itself by many critics. Arirang  is a mad choice; the movie was lazy and
indulgent and easily the worst of the festival for me.
DIRECTORS FORTNIGHT WINNERS:Top Prize: Les Geants
Runner-up: Atmen/Breathing
Sadly, I went to the Saturday screenings of the award winners but they didn't bother to include Englishsubtitling so I wasn't able to catch these two movies. Les Geants  is by the director of El Dorado , one of
the treats of the fest in 2008, so I was especially disappointed to miss it.
CRITICS WEEK WINNERS:
Grand Priz and Priz SACD: Take Shelter
Special Mention From The Jury President: SnowtownACID/CCAS and Very Young Critics Prize: Les Acacias
Take Shelte r is the solid followup to director Jeff Nichols' excellent debut Shotgun Stories.
QUEER PALM
The Queer Palm award (for the best movie with LGBT themes) went to Beauty/Skoonheid,  the first
Afrikaans film to screen at Cannes in a main slot (in this case, under Un Certain Regard).
Last year was the first for this award, which went to Gregg Araki's Kaboom . This year's festival was
notably thin on movies tackling LGBT issues and characters.

<p>Palm Dog: Uggy for The Artist
Special Jury Prize: Laika for Le Havre
This goofy award is given to the best performance by a canine at the festival. It must have been a
landslide for Uggy who is one of the best screen dogs since Asta in the Thin Man  movies.
HOW GOOD WAS THIS YEAR'S FEST?
Ultimately, I judge a festival not by the amount of work I was able to snag or the fun I had, but simply by
the number of good movies I saw. Almost every year, someone says "This is the worst Cannes ever." Butinvariably, I end up with two or three films that will make it on my best of the year list. That's prettygreat, if you can catch two movies that will rank among your favorites in just a 12 day period. But thisyear at Cannes I saw four films I rated 3 1/2 stars or 4 stars and all will likely be in my Top Movies OfThe Year list come January 2012. Toss in another six movies I gave 3 stars to and I must say this is a
stellar year. I saw 40 movies and one out of every four was good or great. Who can ask for anything
more? Those top four movies? The Tree Of Life, The Footnote, The Artist  and The Kid With A Bike .
You'll find links to all my coverage below along with a complete list of the movies I saw and links to thosereviews.
