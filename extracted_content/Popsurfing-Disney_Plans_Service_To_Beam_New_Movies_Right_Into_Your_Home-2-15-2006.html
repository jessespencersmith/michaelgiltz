            <p>W E D N E S D AY,  F E B R U A RY  1 5 ,  2 0 0 6Disney Plans Service To Beam New Movies RightInto Your HomeDisney just announced a new service to compete with Netflix and DVDrentals. Called MovieBeam, it promises to send regular and hi-defmovies right into people's homes. Disney got a bump in its stock, whileBlockbuster took a hit. The service includes all the major studios andjust launched in 29 major cities. But so what? It's a terrible idea thatwill flop. People are expected to buy a $200 set-top box (which they'llpresumably balance on top of their cable set-top box and the DVDplayer and perhaps that old VCR as well). Then they pay $30 for aninstallation fee and then pay $5 to watch new releases and $2 for oldertitles. The box comes loaded with 100 titles and Disney rotates in tennew releases a week. In short, you have an incredibly limited number oftitles to choose from, you pay more than you would at Blockbuster, aLOT more than you do at Netflix and you have to buy anotherexpensive box for the privilege of doing so. And does it somehowprovide a better experience than the VOD with countless titles alreadyavailable from most people's cable companies? Not in the least.MovieBeam is a joke and I have no idea why Wall Street fell for it.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
