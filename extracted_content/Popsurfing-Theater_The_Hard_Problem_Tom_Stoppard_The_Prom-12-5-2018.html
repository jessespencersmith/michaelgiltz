THEATER: Time For Stoppard To Stop?; A "Prom"
To Forget
THE  HARD  PROBLEM  ** out of ****
MITZI  E.  NEWHOUSE  AT  LINCOLN  CENTER
Most artists have a creative peak of 10 or so years, assuming they have
any peak at all. Everything before and after that all-too-brief period
when they have Something To Say or at least A New Way To Say It isjust more of the same. It's the necessary work leading up to thatbreakthrough and the downslope where they repeat themselves, as one
will. Stoppard is one of the many greats that disprove this rule, since
he was dependably brilliant from at least 1967 through 2002 (orRosencrantz  and  Guildenstern  Are  Dead  through The  Coast  of
Utopia ). For all I know, his radio play Darkside  and the TV miniseries
Parade's  End  would extend the streak another decade. I've yet to  
catch either.)
So it's partially protectiveness and stupidity that makes me wonder
after 15 or so years of unsatisfying stage work whether Stoppard
should stop. The answer -- obviously -- is no, he should not. Not
writing would perhaps be like not breathing for him. I would enjoy amemoir if he's the sort that might deliver a good one (some people aretoo circumspect for such an effort). And I'm not ready to give up thethrill of a new play by Tom Stoppard, the way friends ask in a rush if Iknew he had a new play at Lincoln Center and why hadn't they heard
of this and dear god it's already sold out and can I help them buy
tickets somewhere, someway, somehow?
So the hard problem is not figuring out whether the new Tom
Stoppard play is good or not. It's not. The hard problem is not figuring
out when it goes off the rails. The play never really coheres but it fallsapart precisely at the moment where a hard-charging American offinance chews out an underling and said underling collapses to theMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>ground in a farce-like manner and you wonder for a second if you've
wandered into a different play. The hard problem is figuring out
exactly why  it doesn't work. Since Stoppard has been grappling with
this play for at least three years (it was first staged in London at theNational in 2015), I imagine he's been grappling with this samequestion.
One thing is certain:  The  Hard  Problem  is unquestionably
Stoppardian. It involves very clever characters discussing weighty and
complex ideas, batting them about like tennis balls -- playfully or moreoften aggressively, to score a point. Two college students are sparringwith one another on their way to what we assume will be an enjoyable
shag. Hilary (Adelaide Clemens) takes the side of ethics and morality
while her Teaching Assistant superior Spike (Chris O'Shea) mocks thevery idea of morality and sees everything -- even altruism -- as a formof self-interest. Spike is mildly insufferable, until he takes his shirt offand one objectifies him quite rudely and is willing to let the smugnessslide. The only moment of true surprise in all this is when Spike is
showering and Hilary kneels primly on the floor and says her prayers.
Everything here feels slightly off, from the way Hilary prays (rather
sheepishly, which makes the eight year old pretense of kneeling a littlehard to swallow) down to their somehow unconvincing names. Spike?
Hilary? I spent the entire play trying and failing to remember their
names. He's not a bad sort and does offer helpful advice. Before youknow it, Hilary is interviewing at a nonprofit called the Brain Institute.Most of its work is rigorously empirical and Hilary expects to lose outto the numbers guy Amal (Eshan Bapjay). Instead Amal is shunted
into the world of hedge funds and Hilary gets to tackle the hard
problem of defining consciousness. It all leads to an experiment led byHilary and her whip-smart new assistant Bo (Karoline Xu) that goessmashingly, headline making, mainstream magazine reportably well.Sort of.The Movies, Books, Theater,

<p>The problem is none of it convinces. One of the great marvels of
Stoppard's career is how the clever-clever showing off of early plays
like Travesties  and Jumpers  deepened into the rich, glorious humanity
of his mature masterpieces Arcadia,  The  Invention  of  Love  and The
Coast  Of  Utopia.  From start to finish, Stoppard tackled big themes.
But he created a body of work where those ideas were embodied inand illustrated by characters we cared about, living and breathingpeople who brought those ideas to life. You don't have to give a tossabout the gardening philosophy of England's past to be moved by
Arcadia  or follow the cross-currents of the Russian Revolution to root
for the people in Coast    of  Utopia.  Stoppard made both the ideas and
the people thrillingly real and important.
Not so here. The play trots along -- deceivingly enough -- nicely
elevated by the performance of Clemens and O'Shea and Robert
Petkoff, who makes Hilary's boss Leo interesting through sheer talentalone. You never quite buy it but it's watchable. Then it disintegrates.That bizarre pratfall of a scene where Amal faints during an atypicaltirade by the institute's founder Jerry seems from another planet.
Hilary at times breaks down over the memory of the daughter she had
to give up in her youth, though she does so in a manner that is strangeand unconvincing, to say the least. (No points for making a connection-- at least emotional -- between this long lost child and the similarlynamed adopted daughter of the Brain Institute's founder.) Then Spike
behaves in a viciously rude manner that has no link to his earlier
behavior; Spike was sometimes boorish but never mean. Toss in notone but TWO unrequited loves that we'd never know existed if itwasn't suddenly spelled out, not to mention a drawn-out ending thatties everything up too neatly and you've got a mess of a play that atleast knew enough not to bother with an interval.
Jack O'Brien directs smoothly but can't make emotional sense of this
hash. It is presented in the intimate Mitzi E. Newhouse as well as canbe expected. If the staging comes from the play, it too is confusing. A
group of observers dubbed the ensemble watches the play from the
wings and gracefully moves in and out with props and the like. Theyand the cast very modestly interact -- smiling at or acknowledgingeach other and the audience in a mysterious, if friendly way -- but towhat purpose I can't imagine.
For me, the play barreled past one decent ending, the moment when
one character looks up to heaven and says simply, "Thank you." It wasa graceful nod to the inexplicable, the ineffable, the desire to knock onwood and be grateful when things go right for a bloody change. But it
didn't stop there, sad to say.
The hard problem the title refers to, the question of where and how
and really IF consciousness arises is a challenging one. I imagine youcan tell when a play you are writing gains consciousness, that is,
becomes its own living breathing thing. Characters start saying things
that surprise the playwright. Those lines are unexpected, "wrong," but</p>
<p>so very right. Events start to insist on happening even when careful
plotting was supposed to go that  way instead of this . Even a playwright
as great as Stoppard might not know how  such a thing happens. But
he's seen it time and time again. And I'm willing to bet he'd admit it
never really happened with The  Hard  Problem . Ah well, there's always
next time.
THE  PROM  ** out of ****
LONGACRE  THEATRE
Ok, I never cared about my high school prom. You asked a date, you
wore a tux, you danced, so what? Maybe it was self-defense for an(unwittingly) closeted gay kid who was too nerdy/dorky to snag thehead cheerleader (or football quarterback) of cinematic dreams even ifhe wanted them. I was above it all, I guess, or wanted to be, thoughnot so superior I refused to go or anything like that. I wasn't a rebel. Ijust didn't take it seriously or expect this was the night I'd lose my
virginity or remember as a romantic highpoint of my young life. I also
never thought high school (or college or middle age) was supposed tobe the best time of my life. Call me Buddhist but I stay in the moment.I enjoyed high school. I enjoyed college. And I'm enjoying now.
But, you know, I get it. Prom. Prom!! I've seen enough movies to know
it matters or is supposed to matter to others. So I'm perfectly willingto go along with The  Prom,  the benign new musical about a teen girl in
the heartland who just wants to take her girlfriend to the prom. (In
London, the musical Everybody's  Talking  About  Jamie!  is about a boy
who just wants to wear a dress to prom.) Actually, it's not really about
that lonely lesbian standing up for herself.
It's really  about some self-centered Broadway stars trying to recover
from their flop new musical about Eleanor Roosevelt. It gets such
poisonous reviews they know they must do something to rehabilitatetheir images. Sure, "self-centered" and "Broadway star" is redundantbut Dee Dee Allen (Beth Leavel) and Barry Glickman (BrooksAshmanskas) are really self-centered, even by the standards of the
Great White Way. They need a cause, something to prove they care,
damnit! Then they can get some good publicity and move on to theirnext shown with a nice little boost in their Q ratings. Lo and behold,they stumble across the story of a poor little teen in nowheresville who
can't bring her girlfriend to the prom. Before you know it, they and
their friends (and the cast of a non-Equity production of Godspell )
have descended on that small town to raise some holy hell.
You can plot out the rest. The stars get a little humbled and realize to
boot that the hicks in hicksville aren't such hicks after all. Said hicks
learn not all sodomites are sad and big city folk aren't so bad once you
get to know them. Everyone sings a little, dances a little, lessons arelearned and if you don't know whether that lovelorn teen Emma(Caitlin Kinnunen) gets to go to prom with her gal, well then you've</p>
<p>never seen a Broadway musical comedy OR the Macy's Thanksgiving
Day Parade!
What's surprising is how often The  Prom  fails to match even those
modest standards. The book is by Bob Martin and Chad Beguelin, the
lyrics by Beguelin and the music by Matthew Sklar. And between them
in various configurations they've been involved with shows like The
Drowsy  Chaperone  (Martin's triumph), The  Wedding  Singer,  Elf  and
Aladdin  (a terrific show and a triumph for Beguelin). Toss in Casey
Nicholaw of The  Book  of  Mormon  (and Mean  Girls  and Something
Rotten  and the new London Dreamgirls ) and you've got a lot of talent
that should know better.
Among the many problems? The big city know-it-alls never really
learn a lesson. Not one. In act one Dee Dee Allen does deign to go toApplebee's with school principal Mr. Hawkins. But he's played by the
charming Michael Potts and the principal is a super fan who can
recount her every role. His idea of romance is telling Dee Dee howimportant her work is to regular folk ("We Look To You"). Any celebmight be willing to spend an hour to hear that, especially when it's so</p>
<p>sincere. In act two, the celebs learn that when you fail at something
you never really cared about, you can always buy some goodwill by
breaking out the credit card.
Barry Glickman tries to be besties with Emma, the teen who really
didn't want her life turned into a Cause, thank you very much. Howdoes he do this? Well, when the prom seems to be happening, he asks
Emma what she's going to wear and then scoffs at her desire for a tux
and some high tops. Nope, he insists she glam and fem it up. Really?Really! In this post-Ellen, #MeToo world he simply ignores whatEmma really wants and insists she conform to his cisgender, straight,John Hughes idea of what a girl SHOULD wear to the prom (as any
self-respecting Broadway queer at a rally might loudly protest). You
might well expect this is a set-up for Barry to learn a lesson! Butno...she just goes along with it and wears what he wants and looksnice, as far as he's concerned. It's almost bizarre how tone deaf theshow is on this key issue. And if you think it's a minor matter...well,IT'S PROM and what you wear matters! They even do a whole number
about it, for Pete's sake. And if you don't care what you wear, well that
should be respected too.
It gets worse. In act two, fellow actor Trent Oliver (a deadpan
Christopher Sieber) points out that the PTA and the Broadway starsand the media are all arguing about the prom...but no one is talking to
the kids! So he goes to talk to the kids. Of course, all he really does is
put on a backwards baseball cap, hang out at the 7-Eleven and whenthe kids finally recognize him (he was in a hit sitcom way back when),well, HE does all the talking. And that's one of the good numbers!
The kids are clueless Christians who are supposed to be dumbfounded
by the idea that passages of the Bible forbid tattoos and divorce andthe like. (In the real world, Trent, they'd be quoting Scripture and
dismantling his banal take on Scripture faster than you can say
"Vacation Bible School!" Oh they'd be wrong when they say it's love totell a lesbian she needs to change her ways, but they'd hardly besurprised by what he preaches.) In other words, small town folk aren'tso isolated and clueless as the show thinks and lots of Broadway stars
come from small towns and love small towns, even if they don't love
its politics. You don't really expect a light Broadway musical comedy tobe wildly nuanced but the stereotypes of 60 years ago don't worktoday. A show can be silly but it still needs to be smart. And surely oneof the dozens of producers should have noticed that the thankless role
of the agent/publicist played by Josh Lamon had about ten lines, none
of them necessary and could be easily cut.
What does work is the talent on display, doing their best with very
modest material. Act one is thoroughly forgettable, but act two starts
out strong. It begins with "Zazz," a song where actress Angie (Angie
Schworer -- and I could have schworn she is a kid sister to JaneKrakowski) shares a little showbiz stiff upper lip advice to Emma. It atleast feels rooted in the real world, with a Broadway hoofer offering up</p>
<p>what she knows best: jazz hands. That's followed by "The Lady's
Improving," in which Dee Dee apologizes to the principal by
reenacting the breakthrough number from her first big show. It hasthe benefit of ignoring the musical at hand and offering up a
parody/tribute to showstoppers of the past, a la The  Drowsy
Chaperone.  And even Trent's "Love Thy Neighbor" perks things up.
That's three in a row of not-bad stuff, but that's about it.
Still, Leavel and Potts as the Broadway diva and the principal bring
some actual humanity to their scenes together. Ashmanskas is toocheerful to dismiss entirely even in these flimsy surroundings, whileSieber has the best line of the night, thanks to his dry delivery. They allhave moments, including Kinnunen as the teen Emma. It's easy to
forget about her, just like the celebs do. But she is pretty winning, with
an easy, open presence that makes you care for her even when theshow can't be bothered.
