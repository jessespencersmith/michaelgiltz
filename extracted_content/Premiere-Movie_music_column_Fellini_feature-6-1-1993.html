SCORING 
FEDERICO FELLlNI'S RECENT HONOR­
ary Oscar could just as easily be a trib­
ute to composer Nino Rota. Their 
work is inseparable--La Dolce Vita or 
8'/2 without Rota's mischievous 
hurdy-gurdy music is simply unimaginable . 
He worked successfully with many, but his 
Fellini collaborations are an artistic high 
point. Here's a selection of Rota's best. 
• La Dolce Vita (CAM). With Rota and 
Fellini, the sounds of the circus are never far 
away: soft melodies are pushed aside by gid­
dy marches or big-top fanfares with alarm­
ing regularity. Less interesting are the non­
Rota stabs at jazz standards. 
• 8Y2 (CAM). More sly fun, with a witty 
co-opting of Wagner that predates Apocalypse 
Now by sixteen years. Rota's melange of 
musical styles and neck-snapping tempo 
changes hints at influences from such cartoon 
composers as Carl Stalling. Other worth­
while Fellini scores: Amarcord (CAM) and Ju­
liet oj the Spirits (CAM). 
• The Godfather (MCA). The main theme 
could hardly be better; it embodies strength 
and the dark price of power 
with striking simplicity. Un­
fortunately, there's little 
else--just a few variations on 
the theme, a snippet of music 
from Carmine Coppola, and 
... it's over. 
• Romeo & Juliet (Cloud Nine Records; 
imported). Rota at his most romantic, en­
hancing Franco Zeffirelli's sexy teen version 
of Shakespeare. The "Love Theme" is right­
fully a classic. A void the Capitol Records 
version, which is virtually all dialogue--the 
score is relegated to the background. 
• Fellini's Movie Songs (Milan). A just­
released testimonial to Rota's enduring 
popularity. It combines new lyrics with the 
composer's classic themes, all sung by chan­
teuse Katyna Ranieri. Movie Songs will be 
hard-pressed to equal Hal Willner's classic 
tribute album, Amarcord Nino Rota (Hallllibal 
Records); the latter features Wynton Marsa­
lis, Bill Frisell, and others improvising on 
Rota to great effect. MICHAEL GIL TZ
