4/24/2005 03:18:00 PM"Justice Sunday" is creating a real quandary for Republicans. Itplays well with the fringe far right religious groups -- what dothey care about responsible government when the Rapture iscoming any day now?But the LA Times reports major business groups think the"nuclear option" is bad for business. While the radical ReligiousRight will be thrilled if the government is shut down, majorbusiness lobbies like the US Chamber of Commerce andRoundtable are telling Frist they'll be annoyed if theirlegislation gets bogged down and they won't be supporting hisradical agenda.So if Big Business can stand up to the radical far right, whycouldn't Microsoft? Why couldn't Microsoft simply say, "Webelieve in equal rights for ALL of our employees?" Is thatradical? Some fringe groups can try and claim you're"offending" them by not attacking your employees andcustomers by trying to deny them basic rights under companypolicy and the law, but ultimately that dog won't hunt -- no onecan pretend you're prejudiced by calling for equal rights foreveryone. But Microsoft got scared of the religious wrong.
