            <p>Newer PostOlder PostW E D N E S D AY,  F E B R U A RY  0 8 ,  2 0 0 6Dark Matter -- I Think They're Making It UpI love stories about the scientific idea of "dark matter," maybe in partbecause it served as the title for one of my favorite fantasy works of alltime: His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman. But how wacky canscientists get? This BBC news story on dark matter refers to the VeryLarge Telescope facility in Chile, insists that dark matter comes in a"magic volume" which happens to correspond to an amount that is 30million times the mass of the sun and now we're told that whilescientists used to think the Milky Way was the smallest galaxy in thelocal universe but now they think it's the biggest. And what exactly is a"local universe." I think they're making it all up and it's wonderful.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
