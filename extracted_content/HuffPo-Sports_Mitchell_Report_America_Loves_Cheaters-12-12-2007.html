George Mitchell's big report has come out naming names -- like Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte --
of current and former players who broke federal law, risked their health, cheated their teammates,cheated their fans, cheated their opponents and cheated baseball in general, thus pushing kids inhigh school and the minor leagues to damage their bodies and break the law by doing the same. Bigwhoop. (Go here for Roger I. Abrams' post on what's more American than a home run hitter onsteroids and go here for Gary R. Gaffney's post on a paradigm shift in MLB culture  and go here for
Paul Finkleman's post on baseball, steroids, Bonds and BALCO.
You wanna know what the fallout will be? Zip. MLB doesn't care about cheating. Commissioner
Bud Selig doesn't care. Certainly the players who cheat don't care. Rather bizarrely, even theplayers who don't cheat don't care. And the fans don't care either. Everyone has made it perfectlyclear in the past few years they couldn't care less about performance enhancing drugs (PEDs),about breaking the law, about cleaning up the game and making sure teams compete on an evenplaying field where no player feels they have to risk their health, their life and break the law just tokeep up with the Jason Giambis of the world. (I'm a Yankee fan, by the way.)
The names will be named. The fuss will be huge. Maybe some of them will get some days of
suspension. The rules will get tweaked a little. And then it will be over.
But look at Barry Bonds, right? He paid a price. ButBarry Bonds isn't facing jail because he cheated andtook PEDs. He was offered full immunity just like thecheater Jason Giambi. But Bonds lied about what hedid under oath. If he hadn't, he'd probably bewelcomed by now as having been a "man" and come
clean, just like Giambi has been. (All Giambi really did was get caught and not be dumb enough tolie on the stand about it.)

<p>Michael Giltz: Mitchell Report: America Loves Cheaters
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-giltz/mitchell-report-america-_b_76495.html [4/5/2009 8:17:03 PM]Even now, some team might sign Bonds for '08, as absurd as that should be. Oakland A's pitcher
Dan Haren is typical when he says that he and his teammates have talked about the possibility ofBonds joining their team for years and that Bonds would be welcomed with open arms.
Certainly the A's fans would do the same. And fans matter more than anyone else. If they were
disgusted by the rampant cheating, baseball would change its ways. But fans of baseball don't careabout the cheating any more than the fans of football, basketball and other sports. One thing iscrystal clear: if another team's player is caught breaking the law and using PEDs to get an unfairadvantage, opposing fans have a new taunt they can throw out. If it's their player who cheated?They could care less. Bonds was cheered by his hometown fans. So were Jason Giambi and GarySheffield by Yankee fans. So is virtually every active player tainted by the scandal.
Jay Gibbons and Jose Guillen have been suspected of cheating since February. What happened?
Did their teams shun them? Did their fans boo them? Did little kids look up to them and say, "Say
it ain't so, Jay/Jose?" Of course not. Their parents don't care. Why should the kids? Jay is a proud
member of the Orioles. Last week, despite the cloud of shame that should hover over him, Guillen
signed a three year, $36 million deal with the Kansas City Royals. Now they've both been given 15
day suspensions beginning next season. Are the Orioles or the Royals abashed at signing cheaters?
Are they demanding to be let out of the deals? Are fans outraged? Nope. Cheaters prosper. Will the
Yankees dump Andy Pettitte now that they know he's a cheat? Of course not.
Oddest to me is that the players don't care. Derek Jeter of the Yankees -- who I couldn't like and
respect more and, thank God, has not even the whiff of scandal about him -- doesn't care; hesimply ignores the questions and wishes pushy reporters would stop asking them. Again and again,pros of every sport pile on the people asking questions, not the cheats. Charles Barkley and JohnMcEnroe were interviewed by Bob Costas on HBO about this. They said virtually nothing about thesimple obvious fact that cheaters are losers. If they were playing a casual game of basketball ortennis in their backyard and caught someone cheating them, they'd be furious. If they saw kidscheating, they'd surely say that was wrong. But performance enhancing drugs? Oh, was it againstthe rules, asks Barkley? It was against the law, says Costas. Why do you pick on Barry Bonds, saysMcEnroe? I don't, says Costas. All they did was complain about the reporters and the media. Notone word about cheating.
A recent New York Times article pointed out what a joke testing in the NFL is,  with loopholes so
wide you drive a linebacker through them. For starters, no one is ever tested on game day. The
NFL's response? Mind your own business. Baseball's testers call up a day in advance to say they'recoming by to do a "surprise" test. Clearly no one wants to catch anyone. As Charles E. Yesalis ofPenn State said to the Times, "Testing is there to provide the fan, who is already disinterested indrug use, with plausible deniability because the leagues tell the fans the athletes are clean becausethey have drug testing."
Compare this to overseas. Outside the Olympics, the one sport that has the most stringent testing is
cycling. And the constant barrage of cheats that are uncovered has the sport -- one of the most
popular in Europe and the world -- literally on the verge of collapse. The sport is arranged so that
sponsors actually back certain teams, which means in fact backing certain superstars. Those
corporate sponsors don't like being DIRECTLY associated with cheating so they're withdrawing
funding. That's spawned a crisis, which might just be a quirk in how the sport is arranged. But it
also seems fans genuinely care about the cheating in cycling and are sick of it. That's one reason to
look forward to the Olympics: it's the one sport arena where fans know every possible effort is
made to punish cheaters and to allow the greatest athletes in the world to compete with pride using
their natural abilities. Europeans seem to care about cheating. Not us. Not the US. Not by a long
shot.
I think cheaters are losers. I think sports like baseball are a lot less fun when some players have an
unfair advantage. I hate to think of my team winning with the help of cheaters. I hate even more tothink of kids in high school and the minor leagues risking their health and dignity by breaking thelaw to cheat because they believe if they don't they'll never make it to the majors. I don't boo myown team, but I don't applaud when Jason Giambi's name is in the lineup and I wish he weretraded, however nice a guy he may be on a personal level. I just don't like cheaters. And peopleusing PEDs don't make a one-time mistake or suffer a slip of the tongue, the sort of thing anyonemight make and be forgiven for. They choose actively and aggressively to cheat for months andyears at a time and they sometimes reap millions by doing so. I hate cheaters. And I seem to bealone in all this. Sure, Clemens and Bonds and Mark McGwire will have more trouble getting into

$40,000the Hall of Fame. But I predict not one single current player that is valuable to their team will be
dumped. Some team might dump a marginal player they wanted to get rid of and use the report as
an excuse. But that's it. If your player helps the team, there's no way they'll get fired.
Is cheating All-American? I'm starting to think so.

I haven't cared much for MLB or the NFL. Personally, they are too infused with advertising, at their
heart they are corporate sports. That's not to say that events such as the Tour de France or sports likesoccer don't have their fair share, I just don't feel it with them.
Speaking of Le Tour, look to it to see what can happen to a sport affected by steroid use. Many are
saying that it may be dead (I doubt it).

Comments are closed for this entryFor me, if there's one athlete doing steroids, the whole game is tainted. I have ZERO interest in
following and event/sport where an undetermined number of players have a huge advantage. But itsounds like I am in the minority.

We can take this disdain and apathy further. It explains our total indifference to our natural world andthe pigs who are gutting it--which includes the suburbanites who feel they gotta keep up with theJoneses. There is no difference here. Just a change of venue.

There seemed to be a generation of players who had no problem making a deal with the Devil. More
money and prestige for some of their integrity and health. Even those that weren't cheating made the
choice to play dumb and go along. Eventually you'll see a lot of these guys die young from heart
attacks like the "freakazoids" in wrestling who died before 50. It's sad that winning trumps all other
values.

Baseball made the right choice when faced with its own extinction. With modern sports fans requiring
action, and lots of it, baseball continued to move at a snail's pace. Kudos to Selig for not only makingbaseball exciting again, but saving the sport from the trash heap altogether.

Great point. The only unforgivable sin is in fact being a loser. Thanks for reading.

You are correct, sir. Cheating is probably last on list of unacceptable behavior in sports and in life. Thenumber one item on the list of unacceptable behavior? Losing. America loves winners no matter howthey win. It's a disease and it's spreading.
