From the Publisher: "Beats  The Silence of the Lambs  for suspense—it's the
kind of book that had me literally gasping aloud as it rattled to its
incredible conclusion."
—Cory Doctorow,  New York Times  bestselling author of  Homeland
What if the most terrifying person you know is your ten-year-old
sister?
Seventeen-year-old Aussie Che Taylor loves his younger sister, Rosa. But
he’s also certain that she’s a psychopath—clinically, threateningly,dangerously. Recently Rosa has been making trouble, hurting things. Che is
the only one who knows; he’s the only one his sister trusts. Rosa is smart,
talented, pretty, and very good at hiding what she is and the manipulationshe’s capable of.
Their parents, whose business takes the family from place to place, brush
off the warning signs as Rosa’s “acting out.” Now that they have movedagain—from…

What We Say
What if your little sister was Dexter, you know, the lovable serial killer from the Showtime series? That's the hook of this
young adult novel that is both more complex and real but less engaging than that premise suggests. It's ultimately not athriller or even a "raising Dexter" backstory, despite watching the teenager Che try to train his little sister (who lacks
empathy to the level of being a psychopath) how to live in the world and not harm others. What it proves to be is a fairly
complicated novel that gets less and less interesting the more and more it devolves into "The Bad Seed." (A novel name-Share This Book

<p>checked by the author at the end.) Here's the gist: Che is a teenage kid who is mostly homeschooled and moves all over the
world with his do-gooding parents and his little sister Rosa. Che has self-diagnosed Rosa as a psychopath and is learningeverything he can in order to try and keep her from hurting others. Rosa consumes much of his attention. But when thefamily moves -- again -- to New York City, Che sees the wide open world of Manhattan as his biggest challenge yet in
keeping an eye on his budding evil villain sibling. Now put all that aside. The novel is on much firmer ground when author
Larbalestier focuses on Che, his love of boxing, his budding romance with a free-love Christian female boxer namedSojourner and his friendship with an online celebrity friend of the family who is one of the few to realize Che's little sisteris weirdly robotic. The simpler the story, the better. Che debating with Rosa and trying to "trap" her with promises is
effective. An escalating series of Rosa-engineered tragedies? Not so interesting. For a book whose high concept plot will be
the reason most people pick it up, "My Sister Rosa" is at its best when Rosa fades into the background. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
Praise for My Sister Rosa
Publishers Weekly  Best Young Adult Books of 2016
"Not one to shy away from tough subject matter, Larbalestier addresses issues related to gender, sexual
orientation, religion, identity, and race with tact . . .  This dark thriller is the 1956 film  The Bad Seed  meets
2016; readers will be simultaneously terrified when Rosa's present and afraid to let her out of their sight."  
—Kirkus , Starred Review
"A chilling contemplation on human morality—Che’s physical sparring in the ring has nothing on his go-arounds
with Rosa... [incorporates] sharp commentary on privilege, faith, gender identity, and race. The tension of
wondering where and how Rosa will strike next will keep readers riveted from start to finish." 
—Publishers Weekly , Starred Review
"Larbalestier reminds readers of her masterful gift for slippery, unreliable characters... thriller fans will devour
this suspenseful, chilling meditation on the roles of nature and nurture in creating dangerous criminals." —ShelfAwareness, Starred Review
"A tense, thrilling rumination on the psychology…
