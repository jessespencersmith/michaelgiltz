 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyDVDs: Should Steven Soderbergh
Retire From Directing?
CONTAGION  ($29.98 BluRay; Warner Bros.) -- Director Steven Soderbergh has insisted he'll stop
directing movies soon, after a few more projects are finished up. He has Haywire out January 20 with a
kick-ass female action hero; Magic Mike , a film about male strippers; and a Liberace  biopic with Michael
Douglas as the pianist and Matt Damon the down-low love interest. Why walk away from a profitableand interesting career? If Contagion  is any indication, he might simply be bored. It's a fine rough draftMOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>for a smart contemporary drama/thriller about what would help if a pandemic truly broke out in the
world, rather than just being a scare like the avian flu or other genuine health threats that don't follow aworst-case scenario. This film does follow that scenario and dutifully covers all the bases, from regularguy Matt Damon (whose wife Gwyneth Paltrow and son are dead in the blink of an eye) to CDC officials
like Laurence Fishburne and Kate Winslet down to conspiracy theory bloggers like Jude Law. After a
promising start, the only surprise here is how dull the movie turns out to be. In one typical subplot,
Marion Cotillard is a health expert taken prisoner by villagers in China who want to ensure their childrenare given a vaccine as soon as possible after most of them drop dead. A fine, compelling set-up. Then sheis promptly forgotten for most of the film until we pick up her story thread right near the end. The score
by Cliff Martinez is not his best; the performances are fine as far as they go. But no one seems to have
had their heart in it. This is not a frightening, unnerving film the way it should be. And it's all the more
frustrating because all the elements were there. It seemed odd for Soderbergh to announce his
retirement, and surely he'll make more movies some day. But perhaps a break isn't such a bad idea.

ROYAL PAINS  SEASON THREE VOLUME ONE ($26.98; Universal)
By and large, American television does a TERRIBLE job releasing their new shows on DVD. In the UK,
TV shows and movies and miniseries come out on DVD the minute the current season of the show hasended, sometimes even before. In America, the studios rather idiotically have decided to wait until rightbefore the new season has begun to release the previous season. This has two results: one, most peoplewriting about TV write about the new season, rather than the old season coming out on DVD six monthsafter it ended. Two, fans who might want to "join" a show by catching up can't do so because the previousseason comes out so close to the new season. Even worse are kids shows, which often see a single season
broken up into multi-DVD releases that make them expensive and annoying to collect. HBO has added a
new wrinkle to this. They want to encourage people to subscribe to HBO and access their entire libraryvia HBO To Go, so they delayed the DVD release of their high profile series Boardwalk Empire  (with the
pilot directed by executive producer Martin Scorsese) until one month after the finale of Season TWO!
This is a lavish series with a top-notch cast and a very familiar story of gangsters and the feds during
Prohibition. I can't speak to its quality yet since I'm still catching up with episodes that aired some 16months ago and many people have said the show didn't catch fire until season two. But it's certainly well-acted and intelligent. But HBO has it wrong. The more people that watch their shows the more likely theywill be to subscribe.
Hiding a show from DVD for a year longer than necessary goes against everything we've learned about
creative content: make it available to consumers any way they want, whether it's digital, on a tablet, onBluRay, on demand, or via their cable subscription. Keeping Boardwalk Empire  from DVD doesn't make
HBO more desirable. It keeps their shows less well-known and therefore less important. For 16 months, Ihaven't even been able to discuss Boardwalk Empire  or read a single story to avoid spoilers. How is that
a good idea? Season two debuted to lower numbers than the season one finale. On the bright side, it's
only $60 retail on DVD, far lower than HBO's usual premium price.
No one else has gone as extreme as HBO but they don't do it right, either. Anyone wanting to catch up
with one of the wittiest action dramas on TV -- Timothy Olyphant's Justified  -- has one week to watch 13
hours before season three debuts on January 17 on FX. I can't quite get over the idea that Shameless  is
an unnecessary remake of a raunchy UK show. But it has a fun cast and I've been hearing good buzz.Maybe I would have caught up with it before season two debuted on Showtime last Sunday, and if I'dwatched one episode a night since the DVD was released on December 27, I could have just barely donethat. Imagine if it had come out right after the season one finale, just over nine months ago.
Finally, the USA network show Royal Pains  is good junk food with a doctor catering to the filthy rich in
the Hamptons. But now they've split up the season into two sets, releasing volume one now and volume
two later. Fans don't care about scheduling. In this case, 10 episodes aired from June through August andanother six will be broadcast starting January 18. Is that any reason to split the DVD release up? No. wait'til February 22 and put it all out at once. As you can see, if they can screw up the DVD release of a TVshow, they will. The major studios need to radically rethink their approach and understand that putting
out the DVD in as timely a manner as possible in a reasonably priced package will increase the long-term
value of the show.HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3

RetweetOh man. Gorgeous, touching
obituary for Tony Scott by@KevinFCorrigan . This one's a gut-
punch: http://t.co/ajVp7K1L</p>
<p>MONEYBALL  ($40.99 BluRay combo; Sony) -- I don't actually play fantasy baseball but that's about
the only way this movie could be more up my alley. I love baseball (I have season tickets to the Yankees
in the bleachers). I watch the off-season moves with alarm and interest. I appreciate the revolution that
statistics have achieved in how players are measured (though it's gone too far and statistics can be just as
misleading as your "gut".) And I loved director Bennett Miller's Capote . And yet this film left me cold on
many levels. It never transmitted a love of the game. it never brought the players alive. And it certainly
didn't help that Brad Pitt's character avoided the stadium during games. I have enjoyed Jonah Hill, who
stars here as a geeky numbers guy feeding to Pitt ideas on who to value on the team and who to let go.
But Hill spent the entire film frozen, as if someone were holding a gun to his head and telling him thatthis was a "real" film, not one of his dumb comedies and if he ever loosened up or got jokey by God theywould let him have it. It's arid and unpersuasive emotionally and as a look at the changes roiling thegame. I think perhaps the way to humanize the story would have been to focus on the players -- as hardas that is. Watching a catcher like Scott Hatteberg face the trial by fire of adjusting to first base andgetting royally mocked by fans and the media while his bosses insist it'll all work out -- that's a sidebar inthis film but maybe it's where the real drama lies. I suppose sabermetrics would tell you to focus on BradPitt's character, but sometimes you have to go with your gut.
GREATEST SUPER BOWL MOMENTS  ($14.93 VIVENDI/NFL) -- Sports coverage provides endless
amounts of packaging -- greatest touchdown passes, greatest goal line stands, greatest dunking of coachwith water! But this modestly priced DVD contains more than two and a half hours of highlights fromthe first Super Bowl game to the most recent, including Joe Namath, Tom Brady, Marcus Allen and mostevery other highlight that springs to mind when you think of the Super Bowl. If you're an addict, this is agood fix and probably a lot more fun to watch than the pre-game shows that will go on and on and onthis February 5.</p>
<p>MILDRED PIERCE ($49.99 BluRay; HBO) -- This carefully crafted HBO miniseries by director Todd
Haynes spared no expense in bringing the James M. Cain novel to life. But what director Michael Curtiz
told so deftly in under two hours, this miniseries drags out interminably in over five. The adult cast is
solid, with Kate Winslet winning the Emmy as the self-made, self-loathing career gal and Guy Pearcesnagging a supporting actor Emmy for his work as a dissolute man about town. But the insufferable,poorly written role of the daughter Mildred sacrifices everything for is not well played by Morgan Turnerfor the first three, dragging episodes, while the excellent actress Evan Rachel Wood does a little better inthe final two. But it doesn't matter: the miniseries includes a plot twist in the fourth episode that is soabsurdly laughable that the entire miniseries goes off the rails for good. It's the sort of ludicrous detailthat you might include in an old movie where audiences were more gullible but for a modern remakesimply readjust at least a little. Seriously, couldn't the daughter have turned out to be a good pop singer,rather than a full-blown coloratura operatic superstar overnight when it's a skill that takes literally alifetime to master? Plus, drawn out to this length just makes your impatience with Mildred grow andgrow. After all, unless the child is a bad seed, it's her fault for raising such a spoiled brat.</p>
<p>THE GUARD  ($35.99 BluRay; Sony Pictures Classics)
DR. WILLOUGHBY  ($29.99; Acorn) 
BLACKTHORN  ($29.98 BluRay; Magnolia)
FILM SOCIALISME  ($29.95; Kino Lorber)
Four DVDs to catch up on. Don Cheadle is enjoying some of the best reviews of his career for the new
Showtime sitcom House Of Lies . Maybe that will bring renewed attention to The Guard , a seemingly
standard odd couple paring of Cheadle as a tightly wound FBI agent and Brendan Gleeson as a shoot-
from-the-hip Irish cop. I ignored it when it came out but have seen the movie popping up here and thereon end of the year lists as unfairly overlooked. With AbFab  back on the air (if briefly) Joanna Lumle fans
who want to double down on their favorite acerbic actress can catch Doctor Willoughby , a 90s sitcom
about a soap star desperate to maintain her position playing a brilliant surgeon on the sleaziest soap ontelly. What if Butch and Sundance didn't die but retired to Bolivia? That's the premise for Blackthorn , a
western starring Sam Shepard that went completely under my radar. But an online friend touted it as oneof his favorite films of the year and I love westerns so it's on my to-do list. Finally, Jean-Luc Godard isone of the giants of cinema but I've let his prickly personality color my appreciation for his films. (I'm aTruffaut man all the way, always valuing story over intellectual ideas.) Yet, I find an increasing numberof his classic films appealing to me and can't deny it when his latest work Film Socialisme  ranks at #11 on
Film Comment's survey of film critics about the best movies of the year . You simply can't talk about the
best films of the year until you've checked it out. And that's one reason I haven't put out my list: Godardis waiting.
READERS: So tell me what you think. Should director Steven Soderbergh retire from directing? Or just
take a break? And what's your favorite Soderbergh film?
