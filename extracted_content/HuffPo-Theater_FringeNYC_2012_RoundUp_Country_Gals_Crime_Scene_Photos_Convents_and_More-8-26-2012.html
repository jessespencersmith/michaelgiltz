 Amazing Inspiring Funny Scary Hot Crazy Important WeirdTheater: FringeNYC RoundUp --
Country Gals, Crime Scene Photos,Convents and More
FringeNYC  is an annual festival filled with new works --
plays and musicals and puppetry and one-person shows,
all with dreams of catching the eye of producers and
finding further life at other fringe festivals around the
world (where some of these shows began) or heading toOff Broadway or even Broadway. The best new show I
saw was Independents , which is reviewed here. Below is a roundup of some other highlights.
BLANCHE: THE BITTERSWEET LIFE OF A PRAIRIE DAME  *** 1/2 out of ****
I first saw Blanche at the New York Musical Festival -- here's my original, very enthusiastic review.  It was
a treat to see the show again some months later and a second visit only reinforced my initial impressionabout the strength of the songs and the story's overall appeal. I fear 440 Studios did not have greatacoustics for a musical work (though it did have a house manager who offered succinct, original and
engaging introductions for the shows he was hosting). But the quality of the piece by Onalea Gilbertson
shone through again.
CITY OF SHADOWS  *** ouf of ****
I saw this song cycle right after revisiting Blanche and they made an excellent double bill. Artist Rachael
Dease drew inspiration from a series of police photographs taken in Sydney during the turn of thecentury (that does still refer to 1900, doesn't it? Someday soon we'll have to make clear we don't mean2000.) She wrote a batch of story songs and then set them aside; returning to them later she wroteanother batch of less detailed, specific tunes and the result is this show. Dease stands on one side of the
stage with a quartet of musicians lined up on the other. Behind them flash a series of police photographs
(and, I assume, other photos from the era with street scenes and the like) while Dease belts out hersongs. She's a striking performer with a commanding voice and your attention is held throughout. Thephotos, sometimes quite graphic in their capturing of the recently dead, were mesmerizing. My favoriteshowed a body mostly hidden on the other side of a wall, with feet peeking out around the corner and a
streak of blood showing how the body had been dragged mostly out of sight. It was an intelligent,
effective performance though the songs were so general in their nature that they needed the specificity ofthe photos to ground the evening. Perhaps one or two of those more narrative-driven songs would haveprovided a better balance to the tunes. But your attention never wavered, Dease was a striking vocalistand I look forward to checking out her other endeavors down the road.MOST POPULAR ON HUFFPOST 1 of 2

<p>AN INTERROGATION PRIMER  *** out of ****
This show was a lifesaver at FringeNYC for me. After a rough start with four or five shows that didn't
engage and a feeling of despair, my faith was restored by this solid, well-done 35 minute piece. It's based
on a piece written by Mike Nowacki, a soldier who served in Iraq as an interrogator. The presentation isstraightforward: actor Sean Bolger walks out and begins to talk, with merely a desk and a chair onstageto frame his lecture on how interrogation works. "You start by taking off his blindfold," he says matter offactly. In the context of this speech, when Bolger firmly shuts the door to the theater where he's speaking,
it becomes a notable statement of control and isolation. As they say in the show notes, the piece is
delivered in the second person, which avoids the confessional, first person stance of a memoir and theobjective third person perspective of journalism. Without condemning or justifying, the show lays out theexperience of interrogation as conducted by a good soldier who is trying to do a good job. Frustration,lack of preparation (thanks to instructors who have never conducted a real interrogation in their lives),
confusion, boredom, anger and more all come into play. It builds to the interrogator understanding how
some others might lose control and go beyond the pale, bending and breaking the rules or simply not
caring about whether or not a particular person is guilty or innocent. You gain insight into the guys doing
their job as well as they can and those that do not, making the abuses and inevitable failings whenhumans are under pressure in a war zone easier to understand. It ends with our protagonist back in theUS, shadowed by the experience and not quite fitting in, maybe not ever. it's compact, trim and effective,
accomplishing its objectives easily, thanks to Bolger's no-nonsense performance and sympathetic
direction by the adaptor and director Eric Ziegenhagen. It comes from Chicago and when a show travelsfrom that excellent theater town to New York, it's often a sign of good things and An InterrogationPrimer  is the latest example of that.
MAGDALEN  *** out of ****
I admit to a bit of trepidation about seeing a one-woman show concerning the Magdalene Laundries, theworkhouse run by Irish Catholic nuns that was built on the sweat and tears of whores, runaways, sexuallyabused and physically challenged girls and young women. These outcasts were abused by the world and
then abused again by their terrible treatment in this Dickensian institution and I'd heard the stories in
film ( The Magdalene Sisters ) and song (Joni Mitchell's album Turbulent Indigo ). But good art can
reinvigorate any story, no matter how familiar. Magdalen  -- written and performed by Erin Layton and
directed with care by Julie Kline -- has a traditional documentary feel to it. It begins in the present with aperson who has purchased the property where the now infamous laundries were once located and then
leaps back into time, bringing to life priests, nuns (neither villainous though not terribly likable either),
the neighbors who looked down on the inmates and the girls themselves. We see a variety of women butsoon focus in on one girl who was sexually assaulted by her father and in the twisted logic of the day isnow unclean and an outcast. She prays daily to a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, goes to confessiondaily and yearns to become a nun of the order herself so she can be good and get into heaven. While the
outlines were familiar, Layton gave the performance of the festival by embodying with ease all these

PAPER PLANE  ** 1/2 out of ****
I'm a sucker for simple theatricality of the sort embraced by 3 Sticks, the company behind this show. Aladder becomes a tall tree, a rolling metal frame becomes a train, a guy walking on buckets taped to his
feet becomes a scary "bull" determined to beat up anyone attempting to ride the rails for free and so on.
In this tale, a young boy whose mother died long ago discovers she was a daring performer, a wing-
walker who performed at county fairs and the like. Up for adventure, the child heads off to the county fairto see another pilot who might have known his mother. Along for the ride is his best pal and anotherslightly older kid who is always up for adventure. They hitch a ride on the trains, evade the bulls, head to
the circus, ride in a plane and generally have a scary and exciting time of it. The pleasure is all in the
telling and 3 Sticks have inventive minds and some evocative tunes by Andrew Lynch that create a wistful
mood. Their cast information is almost willfully uninformative so I can't be certain who did what. The
handsome devil who played Hank, the best pal in the world to Joseph our hero, was especially engagingthroughout in that and other minor roles, though almost all the cast was solid in their roles, including theother young pal who loved adventure. It was made very clear that Joseph wanted to head off to see the
aeroplane stunt pilots. But it took me quite a while to realize the show was also suggesting that a paper
plane sent aloft by the kid was also teasing him along, providing a guiding light of sorts. This becameincreasingly important at the finale but it wasn't clear to me that in the mythology of the show paperplanes have a mind and life of their own. Maybe I missed some key lyrics in an early song but this couldbe spelled out quickly and simply, maybe by Joseph's father. And the paper plane he's chasing could
reappear a little more often, though this all seems to be redundant since we already have motivation for
his adventure. Another small point is that the "bull" who is sniffing out and tracking down Joseph feelslike a plot twist; if there was more of a sense of him stalking the kids throughout, rather than just a latestory reappearance, this would be more effective and create a better sense of danger. My central problemis with the performance of the actress who played Joseph. Everyone else who plays kids in the show just
plays characters. Granted they're a little older but that's no reason to play a "kid," with bug-eyed
reactions and little boy mannerisms that always seem to hammer home how this is a child, as opposed toa specific child. She's playing to the idea of little children and since everyone else is more naturalistic itthrows off the balance of the show. Simply toning it down and trusting that the character will revealhimself as a little kid without underlining and highlighting that immaturity would work much better.
Still, those songs and the general appeal of the storytelling shine through and it's a company whose work
I hope to see again soon.
RATED M FOR MATURE  ** 1/2 out of ****
This play by Greg Ayers has a promising setup and some very good scenes until it drops genuine drama
for highly improbable and unconvincing plot twists. Mom (Jamey Hood) and stepdad Larry (Brian
Munn) are worried about her teenage son Eric (Ben Hollandsworth). The school thinks he's a drug addictand they're tossing his room looking for Eric's stash when they come across a journal and realize he'sdeeply addicted to online gaming. With Eric failing three classes, Mom just yanks the computer out of hisroom, freaking out Eric so much (his clan has a massive raid planned for tonight against their arch
enemies in the online game Call To Arms) that he literally throws himself at her feet weeping. She stands
firm and Eric is soon an outcast even among his gamer friends, the volatile Pete (Nick Vennekotter) andhanger-on Danny (Patrick Harman). it's a story about addiction and bullying (natch) and high school andstep parents, but unfortunately it becomes a thriller when Pete hatches an absurd plan to blackmail Eric'sstepdad so they can run away to California. That devolves into a kidnapping and guns and a stand-off
with police so the bad seed Peter (his dark home life is merely hinted at) can go truly nuts. This is a
disappointing turn for a show that was fresh and believable when it stuck to reality. Ayers does a veryeffective job of showing the swagger and confidence Eric and his friends feel in their online world. Thebrief scenes of them in their virtual world are funny and effective in showing the appeal of a secondchance for a newer, stronger personality. A few more moments of them escaping into that fantasy realmwould have been welcome. The best scene in the show involved Eric and a counselor. Urged to just talk
without any fear of judgment, Eric talks about how his friends were bullied and administrators did</p>
<p>nothing. The counselor nitpicks at his comments, blithely dismissing them since he wasn't involved and
then again urges Eric to open up.
It's a damning moment that reveals even a well-intentioned official can let kids down. (The fact that he
doesn't ask Eric if he's being bullied is telling. More hard to swallow is Eric's mom embracing the idea ofrehab when she thinks the problem is drugs but scoffing at the idea of therapy, even after her son
practically has a nervous breakdown over losing his computer privileges.) The less convincing their
characters' actions, the less effective the actors. So the parents have the least satisfying parts.
Vennekotter must shoulder the burden of Pete's wildly unconvincing evolution into unhinged lunacy,
though he's good earlier on as just a pushy jerk. Harman is good in the minor role of loser among losers.
Playwright Ayers has potential -- he just needs to trust his characters more and the drama of real life
versus Hollywood. Above all I'll remember Rated M For Mature as a showcase for Ben Hollandsworth as
Eric. He gives a subtle, empathetic, grounded performance throughout, funny in the virtual world scenes
without ever making fun of his character's passion, vulnerable, sweet, and even makes you almost believe
in the over-the-top plot twists towards the end. It is indeed a mature, memorable performance.
THE GREAT PIE ROBBERY  ** 1/2 out of ****
This show is a genial goof, a send-up and celebration of melodramas that used to pepper the stage
around the turn of the last century. The townspeople of Skunk Valley, USA are quite happy and looking
forward to the annual pie-eating contest. Then the evil Vincent Von Villanueva (Mike Quirk) comes in,buying up half the town and threatening to turn their idyllic paradise into an early Las Vegas. While the
villain triumph? Will our hero Chicken Farmer John (Seth Grugle) save the day and realize shopgirl
Clementine (Jennifer Bissell) is his true love? Will Junior (Doug Goldring) avoid the drudgery of life as a
baker and take to the stage? Stop asking so many questions! In case you're not certain of what to do,
castmembers hold up signs telling you to hiss the villain, cheer the hero, sigh over the maiden and so on.This sort of nonsense seems easy in the abstract but there's a skill to mining obvious jokes for new humorand playwright/director Ben Tostado and Playlight Theatre deliver a very promising first effort. The
entire cast is game but especial note must be made of Trip Plymale as Pa Baker, whose deadpan delivery
is priceless. He knows that you don't need to mug to put across a joke.
BOMBSHELTERED  ** 1/2 out of ****
Four young people decide to trip acid in the bomb-shelter of one of their dads. A random radio
announcement convinces them that the end of the world is nigh and a chance to start from scratch istheirs. First they just trip out for a while, which grows tiresome very quickly to watch, just as in real life.There's nothing more boring than being sober or straight in a room full of people on acid. But they soonbegin a mock satire of political structures, with one person announcing he's the king of their new society,
another one overthrowing the king for a communistic government, a third pushing for free elections and
so on. You get a modest backstory about a potential love triangle, but this is essentially a mockery ofdifferent forms of government and how human passion for power and control and freedom can corruptand distort almost any system. If that sounds a bit dry, you're not far off. Playwright Adam Harlan has
delivered a tightly written piece that handles the shifts in moods and explicates economic theory via
Monopoly money (for example) quite nicely. But there's no real story beneath the satire and spoofery, nocharacters to care for that change and grow or are revealed via their shenanigans. The four actors aresolid throughout, tossing off the sometimes explanation-heavy text with ease. But there's too much headand not enough heart for them to bring these people wholly to life. It's telling that the finale -- in which
characters give us an update on what happened to them in years to come -- is uninteresting. We don't
really know them as characters so their fates feel merely random. You can't really dislike a show thatwarms up the audience with the second half of Bruce Springsteen's Born To Run  album and there is care
and craft on display. When Harlan grapples with characters as deftly as he handles concepts, it will beworth checking out.
SHEHERIZADE  ** out of ****
This production via students at Carnegie Mellon makes a worthy addition to FringeNYC with a show that
demonstrates a lot of promising talent. It tackles the familiar tale of a woman who puts off a murderousking by spinning tales that are so captivating he can't bear to kill the storyteller until he's heard the end
and keeps putting off her death night after night until he falls in love and has a change of heart.
Playwright Aidaa Peerzada emphasizes Sheherizade's desire to protect all the other women who would bekilled by this king on their wedding nights, one after the other. And the direction by Priscila Garcia andchoreography by the director of movement/artistic director Anne Marie Bookwalter keep the storyflowing smoothly. Like many classic tales, this one allows actors to double and triple in various roles. Butit was a mistake, I think, to allow the two central roles of Sheherizade and the king be doubled in the
same way. This lowers the tension of her fate and the drama of seeing the king slowly fall in love. Also,
the cliffhanger approach to storytelling is dropped I believe after just one night, so the driving pull of thenarrative is undercut as well, along with her teasing refusal to finish a tale because she's tired, forcing theking to spare her life yet again each night. None of this diminishes the solid cast. One or two minor partsare stumbled over, but the direction and choreography keep the entire production moving along nicely.
It's a good showcase for some young talent.
THE DICK AND THE ROSE  ** out of ****
This show with puppetry tries to make sense of how a parent could kill their own children via a story that
escalates from sexual desire to marriage to kids, to annoying kids that constantly complain and bicker
and moan and beg and plead until the parent(s) feel so overwhelmed and overwrought that they snap. It'snot as dark as this sounds, thanks to the puckish presence of writer and director Robert Biggs as themaster of ceremonies. The problem is that while intellectually it's easy to see how the scenes link</p>
<p>together and the show builds to a finale, in practice each section feels like a separate piece not really
connected to the whole. it doesn't build emotionally even though that's the clear intent. The song in which
the mother feels harangued by her kids is perhaps the most effective. Throughout there are fine touches
by the multi-talented cast. (And the "ministering angels" offer attractive and multipurpose support,especially Jake Elitzer.) it's a serious effort with some evocative music that simply never quite comes tolife.
STORYTIME WITH MR. BUTTERMEN  ** out of ****
Homeless people in Central Park maintain their dignity and sanity by recasting classic folk tales for themodern world. So Aesop's "The Tortoise and the Hare" becomes more about how the tortoise gets soused
on liquor while 'The Grasshopper and the Ant" lands firmly in the camp of the grasshopper and having
fun while you can. Conceived and directed by Christian De Gre with numerous writers chiming in onindividual tales, Storytime with Mr. Buttermen  has a very confused and dark trajectory that is unearned
and unsatisfying. But that shouldn't obscure the fact that the talented cast, strong choreography by PaulaWilson and excellent direction by De Gre are all noteworthy. The main problem is that the modern
retellings invariably fall flat or make points so banal they're hardly worth hearing. "The Emperor's New...
Weapon of Mass Destruction" is against escalating military expenditures. "Pigmailman" warns that it's
not nice to disdain people for their physical appearance. And "The Girl Who Cried Rape" says it's not nice
to falsely accuse people of rape because of course that's wrong and then when someone else finds thecourage to say they've been raped they might not be believed. But "Pigmailman" is a good example ofwhy the show wasn't a waste of time, despite growing less interesting as it went along. The actor NathanWinkelstein played our Christ-like mailman with verve, the song accompanying it was satisfying and the
choreography and direction kept it lively. It's only the book that let this and so many other pieces down.
The cast was solid throughout, though Mr. Buttermen (Anthony M. Lopez) was burdened with the mostexplicit messages and banal exposition so he struggled a bit. Winkelstein and Ashley C. Williams wereamong the many fine talents. But Justin Anselmi shone most of all. He nailed his lines throughout,
mining them for humor and anger and genuine emotion. He also played a homeless person who improv'd
before the show by interacting with audience members as they filed in. Few things send me running forthe doors faster than improv and castmembers that interact with the audience and demand someparticipation. But darned if Anselmi wasn't exceptionally funny and in character. I especially enjoyed hislightning fast switches from self-deprecation to defiance and his offhanded comments were so amusing I
was actually delighted to see he'd do the same schtick during the intermission. Discovering a talent like
his that you want to see again in the future would make shows far less ambitious than this one worthwatching.
MORMON IN CHIEF  ** out of ****
This comedy by Matthew Greene is admirable in its desire to paint a complex picture of people rather</p>
<p>than indulging in easy satire or cheap shots at Mormons and political bloggers. However, it's ultimately
so timid in its fairness that it becomes as dull as our hero, Connor (Jesse Liebman). He's a modest guy
who attends the same temple as the current candidate for President. After the candidate gave a speech to
his fellow faithful, Connor tweeted that the guy wants to save America from the gays and other sins.
Somehow, this innocuous tweet launches a political firestorm with the candidate insisting his words were
taken out of context and every media outlet in the country trying to track down this anonymous tweeter.The tweet even inspires a question at a Presidential debate in which the Mormon candidate blanks out for
an eternity (10 or so seconds) while trying to answer it. Throughout all of this, Connor remains oblivious,
which stretches disbelief even for a fundamentalist. He's finally tracked down by a blogger Lydia (Nicole
Rodenburg), who pushes Connor for a statement but ultimately sees him as a nice if misguided guy she
may disagree with politically but can't demonize personally. A side plot has Connor as the shoulder to cry
on for his friend Kate (a very good Karis Danish), whose marriage is rocky and whose husband is
competing for the same promotion as Connor. Will Connor apologize for accurately describing what he
believes to be the candidate's position on hot-button social issues? Will he stand up for himself and
possibly prevent a man he believes in from becoming President? Or is that man not worth believing in
any more? And while Connor stand up for himself at work or step aside so his friend can get the
promotion he wants and maybe save a marriage? None of this is as remotely interesting as it might be.Connor is bland in the extreme, a polite and friendly guy who is modest but no pushover. He's not
terribly political at all and so his back and forth with Lydia on politics isn't engaging in the least. he
doesn't seem like a mouse so Kate's outrageous request that he refuse a promotion so her husband can
get it hardly seems like a proposal even the quiet Connor would agree to; we don't believe her marriage
depends on it so very little is at stake. So there's very little drama on display here. Liebman is solid as thelikable Connor; it's not his fault the character is bland and rather dull. The play is the same with Greene
not really wanting to grapple with the issues at hand but merely show an even-handed appreciation for
everyone's point of view. That he does, in an evenhanded, unexciting manner. The actors are generally
better than the material and with confidence the playwright might be as well.
DARK HOLLOW  * 1/2 out of ****
This overwrought, uninvolving staging of Woyzeck  in the Appalachians during the Depression is filled
with traditional tunes and a few originals, but the cast has no feel for these songs. The exception is Nick
Mason as Andy, who delivers his solo numbers with a verve and authenticity akin to the plainspokendecency he brings to his relatively minor character.
NON-EQUITY THE MUSICAL!  * out of ****
A poor showcase for actors who don't have their Equity cards that tries and fails to mine the daily travails
of theater hopefuls trying to make it for humor and pathos. Emily Swan has some fun as The Monitor,
the varied personalities who oversee the cattle calls that actors endure every day. But you should neverdismiss someone in a bad show, because you never know. Just when it seemed the cast had nothing tooffer, there was a brief sketch in which they got to audition for a kid's theater piece. Suddenly the actorswho'd been asked to sing banal songs and voice platitudes came alive. Joe Donnelly was funny as the pig,Nichole Turner got a chance to do more than be sassy and Pierce Cassedy delivered an hilarious cartoon
voice as one of the other farmyard animals. That's why struggling actors commit to most anything they
can get cast in: you never know when the right moment with the right material can make you stand out(even in a so-so show) and help you catch the eye of a casting agent or director or playwright who mightjust remember you down the road. The dream lives on....</p>
