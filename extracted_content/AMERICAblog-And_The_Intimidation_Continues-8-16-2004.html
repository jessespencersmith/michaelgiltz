8/16/2004 03:14:00 AMBelow is a story about the FBI targeting apparently law-abidingcitizens who had the temerity to take part in political protests. Nowcomes this depressing column by Bob Herbert about voterintimidation in Florida. Apparently, state police officers have gone tothe homes of elderly black voters (some of whom just happen toorganize "get out the vote" drives in their Orlando community) toquestion them about allegations of voter fraud during the Orlandomayoral election in March. Dozens of people were questioned about acase that officials refused to provide details on, except to say itinvolved absentee ballots. (The very ballots people in Florida maywant to use because of concerns about the new computerizedsystems.) Here's one amusing/disturbing exchange:"I asked if all the people interrogated were black.'Well, mainly it was a black neighborhood we were lookingat - yes,' he said. He also said, 'Most of them were elderly.'When I asked why, he said, 'That's just the people weselected out of a random sample to interview.'"They randomly selected elderly black people? Right. Just like theBushes randomly left Hispanic felons on eligible voter rolls whileeliminating blacks.According to a lawyer who represents the president of the OrlandoLeague of Voters, this "investigation" is working."People who have voted by absentee ballot for years are refusing toallow campaign workers to come to their homes. And volunteers whohave participated for years in assisting people, particularly the elderlyor handicapped, are scared and don't want to risk a criminalinvestigation."Why Florida voters aren't demonstrating in the streets over suspectcomputerized voting, fishy manipulation of voter rolls and now this isbeyond me.
