The Life and Legend of 
WvattEarp ***'h Rhino, $34.95 
ONE of TV's boldest westerns, 
it covers the Career of lawman 
Earp with each season leading 
to a new town -culminating 
in the five-part series finale 
"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral." 
Extras include interviews with 
the star Hugh O'Brian. 
The Man Who Fe~ Earth . *** . Criterion, $39.95 
CRITERION does it again, 
giving this oddball David 
Bowie vehicle about an extra­
terrestrial such wonderful 
packaging, you can't help 
wanting to own it. Bonus 
features include commentary 
from director Nicolas Roeg, 
Bowie and even a paperback of 
the Walter Tevis sci-fi novel it's 
based on. 
Born into Brothels *** ThinkFilm, $29 . ..:.:.9:..:9 ____ _ 
THIS delightful documentary 
about the children of 
prostitutes in Calcutta's red­
light district makes one thing 
clear: Fate can be thwarted Robots ** Fox, $29.98 
GOOD looks only get 
you so far. This 
computer-animated 
flick captures the 
nifty style of 
children's author 
William Joyce, but 
that doesn't make up 
for a routine tale 
about misfit robots 
in the big city. 
with patience and care and 
opportunity. Usually. Many 
extras include footage of the 
kids watching part of the film 
and an update of where they 
are now. 
ALSO OUT 
Intriguing boxing film "Ring 
of Fire: The Emile Griffith Story" 
(Anchor Bay; $19.98). 
"The Adventures of Sharkboy 
and Lavagirl in 3-D" (Dimension; 
$29.99), though flawed, is 
goofily original. 
Keep the kids away from 
"Family Guy Presents Stewie 
Griffin: The Untold Story" (Fox; 
$29.98). A glorified repackaging 
of three episodes with some 
new material, it's strictly for 
adult fans of the show. 
The troubled fourth season 
of "Gilmore Girls" (Warner 
Bros.; $59.98).</p>
