Nat an Lane involves Sondheim,
London's est End, injuries,
Terrence McNal ly, Broadway's
movie calle e Producers
By Michael Giltzike Superman, actor Nathan Lane hirs been coming to
the rescue throughout 2005. First he rewrote the book
on Stephen Sondheim's long-neglected mrsical The
Frogs. Then he dashed off to London's West End at a
moment's notice to open The Producers-to massive
acclaim, of course. A bum knee led to a bad back and a brief
respite back in the United States. Then he filmed the mone ver-
sion of The Producers and tried to rest again But a longtime
friend, playwright Terrence McNally, needed a last-minute lead
actor for his new play, and Lane responded heroically. Again.
That led right into a revival of The Odd Couple on Broadway

<p>that's the biggest hit since. . .The Produc-
ers When you're hot, you're hot
Obviously it's been a very good year. And
exhausting. The Terrence McNally play,
filmingThe Producers, and now The Odd
Couple. Every year has its ups and downs.
Does 2005 seem like a particularly good
year for you?
I don't know I just keep going. I don't
turn around and look at it and say lin a
slightly plummy tonel,'qlVell, this was a
good year." It has certainly been busy. I
finished [my revival of the Sondheim mu-
sicall The -F'rogg and I got this phone call
from [director Susan] Stroman ro go ro
London because things weren't going ></p>

well to open lThe Producersl there. And I had a torn meniscus in
the left knee, which required surgery, but they said I could get
through on just physical therapy while I was doing the show. Then
my back went out because I was compensating for the knee. And I
was in enormous pain. So I le{t a couple of weeks early, and I came
back and had the surgery. Six weeks later I was frlming "Der
Guten Tag Hop-Clop." So it was a whirlwind. That was three
months or four months or whatever it was. I went out to Long Is-
land to finally lie down. And then Terrence lost the actor who was
going to play the lead in Dedication. He was so depressed-and
again it was moments before they were about to open. And I said
llaughingl, "Well...I'll do it." And then I said, 'lMho said that?"
Anyway, it tumed out to be a really good thing for the both of us,
and it was great to work together again. And it certainly helped
hirn out. It was a really great experience that I was back in a re-
hearsal room with him again.
From the outside, the impression was that you and Terrence had had a
falling-out and had been estranged for years. Obviously, his work is
always good, so it wasn't the work that brought you two back together.
What was it?
That was long past. We certainly had been friends. It wasdt like
we weren't friends, and then we did this, and now we were. We
were having dinner together when this all came up. The other stuff
has been overblown. That was a long time ago. When I said, "I1l doou as an i]

it," it meant a great deal to him. Yes, I think it did heal some-
thtng...|nuShsl that I thoughtwas healed.
But it's even more healed.
It s even more healed. It did do something. It rneant a great deal to
hirn, so I'm doubly glad I did it.
l've no doubt you and Matthew Broderick are delighted by the attention
and the sales, but I get the impression from the outside that it's got to
be exhausting. People are expecting sliced bread. You two have done
two shows together, and I think it was The New York Times that

<p>I
Ireferred to your legendary rapport. I thought
surely you should have to do at least l0 shows
together before you can be burdened with
having a legendary rapport.
Exactly. What can you do? You don't have
any control over expectations. We were as
shocked as anyone-the fact that it sold
out before we went into rehearsals was
rather extraordinary and unprecedented.
It's exciting, but you get a little nauseous
thinking about how there will be a lot of
expectations.
Next year you'll do The Gin Game together.
lLauehsl Oh, Jesus. No, I think we'll take a
vacation for a while.
In the mainstream media profiles there were a few
that made you seem very...solitary, melancholy,
sad on the outside because you cry on the inside.
Oh, that s all a lot ofhorseshit.
I wondered if you recognized that or thought,
Who are they talking about?
That's what they decided I had no vote.
Look, a lot of that stems from this article
in The New Yorh Times Magazine that
Alex Witchel did. I've known her for years,
and I like Alex, and she's a good writer,
and it's a well-written article. The one
thing we'd joke about is that I'd say,
"Whatever you do, don't turn this into the
sad-clown article." But you have to live
with that. People take their cues from
that. Many articles have decided she must
have gotten it right It gets to be a little
much. I'm not saying I'm not a complicat-
ed person. But I'm not clinically de-
pressed.
Time magazine had an article onThe Odd
Couple, and one passage was so awkwardly
worded that they made it sound like you were
currently dating Victor Garber.
Oh, I know. And Victor's one of my best
friends. Hilarious. That whole piece-
again, you're sometimes a victim of these
things. There's a guy [the reporter] who
showed up in our dressing room-my
dressing room-and Matthew and I are
sitting there, and talk about clinically de-
pressed, he came in and sat down like this
was the last place he wanted to be. He
said, 'You know, I'm the book guy. I don't
usually do entertainment." I said, "Oh,
OK." He said, "The last piece I did was
Joan Didion." I said, "Well, we're a little
funnier than Joan Didion." So he said, "So
tell me something: What is this 'previews'
thine?"lLaughingl No, no, no.
I'm not lying. I'm not making this up. 'lVhat
is this'previews' thing?' I said,'TVelI, before
we open, we're getting warmed up." And
then he said, '1 guess this Joe Mantello, he's
done a lot. I should have heard ofhim, huh?"
I said, 'Where have you been?" So anyhow,
in the middle of this conversation-because
we're doing Thp Odd Couple, and its about
divorce-he said, 'Well, to tell you the truth,
ifs a little sad because I just got divorced."
And I thought, She mo.de the right decision.
And then the article comes out. There's been
this whole Lhing, "Time magazine wants to
write an article on you!" I spent an hour with
this gentleman, and the article he writes-
he decided that yes, again, emotionally I was
Zelda Fitzgerald. And he referred to
Matthew and me as B-list performers who'd
had no success beforc The Producers. And
you think, WeIl, why did they want us to star
in it? llawhsl Anway, you have to live with
it until it winds up in some dentists office.
And during the run you'll turn 50.
Oh, yes, that's right.
Does that matter to you? ls it exciting?
Sure Now there's a time to look back and
say, Well? It's been pretty good. I'm plan-
ning a big party. I've rented the Rainbow
Room. It'll be a nice celebration. I think
You came allthe way out officially in The
Advocate, which we certainly appreciated. I
wondered if I could compare it to getting mar-
ried for people who've been living together.
They're already basically married, but then
they say the words, and it means something.
How have things been since that final step?
Initially, it didn't have a huge impact-
Everyone in your life knew.
It didn't feel like I'd been hiding anything.
Once you say, "I don't want to talk about my
private life," that means you're gay. Yes,
sometimes it has an impact that I don't feel.
Maybe some young person looking at some-
one successful-if it helps someone, you'd
like to think you did. But honestly, it didn't
change anything for me other than that it
was in a magazine and it was official And
then you have to live with "openly gay actor
Nathan Lane."
It's better than "the private Nathan Lane."
Or "the sad clown." I
