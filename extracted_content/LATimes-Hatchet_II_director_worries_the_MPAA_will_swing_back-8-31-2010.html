‘Hatchet II’ director worries the MPAA
will swing back: ‘I’m scared’
Aug. 31, 2010  | 8:21 a.m.
Adam Green: “I don’t want to be singled out and have them mad at me or
something because they’re a tough organization....”
New York writer Michael Giltz digs deep into the looming unrated release “Hatchet II,”
which arrives in theaters after a major MPAA squabble and plenty of splatter.
The movie “ Hatchet II ” will be unrated when it hits the top 20 or so markets on Oct. 1 via
Dark Sky  and the AMC chain, making it perhaps the widest released unrated horror film since
George Romero’s  landmark “ Dawn Of The Dead ” opened in the U.S. in 1979.
That’s made “Hatchet II” an instant cause celebre among horror fans tired of denuded frightflicks, the latest flashpoint in the endless debate over the MPAA rating system and –- some say–- an ironic victim of the MPAA’s desire to look tough on violence.
For director Adam Green , whose original “Hatchet” grossed $3 million on DVD, the moment is
exhilarating.“This is a great opportunity for [fans] to go see something that they’d never normally gotten to

<p>see in a theater and I think that’s very exciting,” says Green. He spoke by cell from Leicester
Square in London on Thursday night while “Hatchet II” made its world premiere duringFrightfest , the largest horror film festival in the world.
While distancing himself from online headlines like the one on Cinematical , he’s thrilled by the
comments of people like Steve “Uncle Creepy” Barton , the editor-in-chief of horror site
DreadCentral . Barton urges people to make a statement by buying tickets to the film even if
they don’t even live near one of the cities where it’s showing.
“Would you pay 10 bucks to make a statement that you support unrated releases in theaters?”
Barton asked readers . “It’s a lot to ask, but you know what? I would and I will. This release could
very well be an opportunity to change the game as we know it and have begrudgingly acceptedit.”
But in some ways, Green is as nervous as the audience watching his movie. And not in a fun way.
“I’m scared though,” Green admitted. “I don’t want to be singled out and have them mad at meor something because they’re a tough organization….”
MPAA ratings controversies aren’t
unusual and neither are unrated films -–
especially in the art-house world. TheMPAA came under fire for slapping an Ron the acclaimed documentary “ The
Tillman Story ” strictly for numerous
uses of the F-word, including the dyingcomment of football star and battlefield
symbol Pat Tillman . And one of the
biggest foreign language hits of the year is
the unrated “ Girl With The Dragon
Tattoo ,” which has hit $12.5 million at
the U.S. box office.
Like many filmmakers, Green submitted a
cut with some ideas of where he mighttrim to appease the MPAA board.
“We submitted a version,” says Green.

<p>submitted it again. Then they came back
being very specific saying, ‘These arethings we have a problem with and youjust can’t do that.’”
Kirby Dick , the Oscar-nominated
filmmaker who made “ This Film Is Not Yet Rated ,” an expose of the MPAA, laughs when he
hears this description.“That’s a great quote. ‘ You just can’t do that .’ See, they have no standards to refer to,” explains
Dick, whose most recent film is “ Outrage .” “If they said, ‘Look, we have very specific standards
and these standards apply to all films, whether they’re studio or non-studio,’ then that might be
an appropriate rating. Maybe you can disagree with their standards but at least they havesomething to reference to. They have nothing  to reference to.”
Green was braced for the worst and ready to go straight to DVD in order to protect the film afterhis experience with the MPAA the first time around.
“’Hatchet I’ had no effects in it, it had no drug use, it had very little swearing,” says Green.
“Nobody even smoked a cigarette. And they came after it like it was the devil. Now with this one,none of their problems were for sexual content. Their problems were all for the level of violence.”
That, of course, is the exact opposite of the usual complaints about the MPAA, which historically
is far more lenient about violence than sex in major studio releases. Is that an indicator thatsomething else is afoot?
“Again, I haven’t seen the film, so I can’t say,” says Dick. “But it does raise the question. This is a
non-studio film. [The MPAA is] always somewhat vulnerable to criticism that they are perhapsnot rating violence harshly enough. There’s no question that that’s the case. Is it possible thatthey’re now selecting a non-studio film to come down hard on so that it looks like they’reactually doing their job so maybe the next studio film they can let slide?”
Barton of Dread Central believes the MPAA likes to make an example of horror films, which
often come from smaller, independent studios and are less “respectable.”
“You look at movies like ‘Inglorious Basterds’ and movies like ‘The Expendables ,’” says
Barton. “They are way, way  more violent than the original ‘Hatchet’ was. What makes it OK for
them to say, ‘Hey, well you can put this out there but this silly movie that’s meant purely for fun
in a tongue-in-cheek manner, that has to get cut to shreds because it’s a horror movie?’”DC  Deadpool  Dean Haspiel  Deborah Vankin

Report
Green believes if his film had been released by a major studio that Hatchet II would have sailed
through easily.
“I think this movie should have gotten an R with some appropriate trims,” says the 35-year-old
filmmaker. “But it is extreme and I think it probably is one of the more gory movies out there.However, it’s all in good fun and nobody’s going to walk out of this feeling like their eyes got
raped or they’re disturbed or having nightmares or anything. They’re just going to laugh. That’s
why it’s so fun. If we had taken that stuff out, it’s like telling a joke without the punch line.”
Green has no desire to be seen as battling the board.
“I don’t want to start a fight with the MPAA,” he says. “We’re just choosing to go a different
route. If the movie is successful and the fans show up, it could change the way horror movies arereleased and I think it’s time for that. I’m not purposely trying to lead a revolution. I’m justtrying to do my thing.”
He adds finally: “The movies I’m making are not disturbing; they’re not messed-up. There’s
nothing different about them than what else is out there. So if they don’t want to play, I just
won’t play with them.”
