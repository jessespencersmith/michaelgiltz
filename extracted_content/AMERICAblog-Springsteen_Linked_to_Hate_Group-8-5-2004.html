8/05/2004 10:51:00 PMLots of articles about the swing-state tour featuring BruceSpringsteen, John Mellencamp, the Dixie Chicks, R.E.M., DaveMatthews and others -- and they all had a bizarre quote from Bush'smedia director Mark McKinnon saying it was a shame these artistshad decided to affiliate with a hate-filled fringe group. Huh? Not till Iread the NYT piece did I realize he was referring to MoveOn.org. Hisjustification? That long-ago competition they sponsored in which oneentrant made mocking comparisons between Bush and Hitler that wason their website briefly among many other finalists before it wastaken down. For that they're a hate-filled fringe group? Way todemonize those who disagree with you and add to the divisiveness inAmerica, Bush.JOHN'S ADDITION TO MICHAEL'S POST: It's a shame that Bushmedia director Mark McKinnon has decided to affiliate himself with ahate-filled candidate.
