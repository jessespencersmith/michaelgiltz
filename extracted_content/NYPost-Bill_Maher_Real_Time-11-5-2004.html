            <p>Bill Maher wants to teach 
Jon Stewart some manners 
By MICHAEl GIL TZ 
Los Angeles may be a 
particularly blue state 
the day after the elec­
tion -"it's like a funeral 
home out here," jokes Bill 
Maher. 
He winds up the latest 
season of "Real Time 
With Bill Maher" on 
HBO tonight at II p.m. 
and then is off to New 
York for a one·night 
stand at Carnegie Hall, 
Dec. 3 
Maher. who believed 
that John Kerry was going 
to win. said he was just 
about to rewrite his act to 
replace all the Bush jokes. 
Then he starts laughing. 
"Well, I guess I don't 
now. There's the bright 
lining in my cloud." 
Now that the election is 
over, Maher's HBO show 
is going on hiatus ~ And 
just in time for the news 
business 
Like Jon Stewart, he's a 
fierce critic uf the medial 
though Stewart does 
"fake" news while Maher 
does substantive inter­
views that hold major fig· 
ures accountable. 
"I have to say, one rea· 
SOR that the candidates 
doP't have to talk to the 
neWs media is they, can 
gO,on shows like his:," 
sa,s Maher. who qUIckly 
adds that Stewart's show 
is very funny and he's ap· 
preciative of nice com­
ments Stewart has about 
his work. 
"I thought what he said 
to Tucker Carlson . , . 
well, I didn't totally dis­
agree with his message. I 
disagreed with how he 
delivered it because I 
thought it was iii-man­
nered. "But I also thought he's 
not the right messenger 
for that message. I'm 
sorry -this isn't just 
with Jon Stewart; I've 
said this for years -
when candidates can go 
on fluff shows and get 
fluff questions, of course 
they're going to avoid 
harder question shows. 
"The broader question 
Jon is talking ahout there 
-he's criticizing CNN, 
and CNN does deserve 
criticism for being roo 
fluff),. CNN to me is like 
what happened to MTV. I 
used to turn it on to see 
videos, and now I can't. I 
used to be able to turn on 
CNN and make sure I saw 
hard news and now some­
times I see some town 
hall meeting? That's not 
what I used to watch 
CNN for." 
Switching last year to 
HBO and getting to revi­
talize what even he ad­
mits was a stale formula 
on ABC has given Maher 
(he biggest creative 
boost tn his career. 
"We used to have 
meetings rat ABC], and 
I'd say 1 want to talk to­
night about the wall in 
Israel," says Maher. 
"But we have on Car­
rot Top and Pam An­
derson. She can only 
talk about animal 
rights and he can 
only talk ahout pop 
culture. 
"One time-I 
think Carson Daly 
was on the show -we 
were talking about Bos­
nia and he just listened 
and finally said, 'What are 
you guys talking about?' 
Well, at least that's real. 
That's a very honest re­
sponse. But at that mo-ment, I should have quit." 
And now Maher has to 
quit the interview. His 
stand-up routine may be 
intact -thanks to Bush's 
re-election -but to­
night's HBO finale needs 
a lot of work. 
"We wrote all this stuff 
yesterday and Monday 
because we thought 
Kerry was going to win," 
says Maher. "I've got a 
whole new show to 
do!" Bill Maher 
closes another 
season of "Real 
Time" as the 
"other" political 
funny guy.</p>
