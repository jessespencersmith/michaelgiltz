Funny Man: Mel Brooks
By Patrick McGilligan$40, HarperOut March 19
In his heart of hearts, Mel Brooks has always been a Broadway baby. Doomed to a life of

<p>2000 Year Old Man made Brooks famous in his own right. And that was followed by sitcoms (Get

The Producers , based on his original film. Author Patrick McGilligan covers it all, including classic
Brooks masterpieces such as Young Frankenstein  (itself a Broadway musical and just revived in
a new and improved, slimmed-down version). Funny Man  is a substantial, serious look at a
compulsively silly man who knew from an early age that when you’re looking for a laugh,anything goes.
