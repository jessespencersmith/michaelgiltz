MoreThe Case Against the Supreme Courtby Erwin ChemerinskyPrice: $30.00(Hardcover)Published: September 25, 2014Rating: 0.0/5 (0 votes cast)From the Publisher:A preeminent constitutional scholar offers a hard-hitting analysis ofthe Supreme Court over the last two hundred yearsMostAmericans share the perception that the Supreme Court isobjective, but Erwin Chemerinsky, one of the country’s leadingconstitutional lawyers, shows that this is nonsense and always hasbeen. The Court is made up of fallible individuals who basedecisions on their own biases. Today, the Roberts Court ispromoting a conservative agenda under the guise of following aneutral methodology, but notorious decisions, such as Bush vs.Gore and United Citizens, are hardly recent exceptions. Thisdevastating book details, case by case, how the Court has largelyfailed throughout American history at its most important tasks andat the most important times.Only someone of Chemerinsky’sstature and breadth of knowledge…Rate This Book|Rate/ReviewAdd To BookshelfGet This Book

Personalize / Add More ChoicesWhat We SayA note of resigned melancholy animates this sober, reasoned takedown of the Supreme Court's fulfillment of its duty:namely, protecting minorities from the tyranny of the majority and upholding the Constitution. Chemerinsky says hehas spent most of his life in denial about its failings. As a young man, he saw Watergate prove that even thePresident wasn't above the law and the Supreme Court has been the bulwark making that happen, right? For all itsflaws, surely it has done more good than harm. Look at the Warren Court, he's always said. Here the author -- ascholar of constitutional law and author of a standard textbook used in academia -- does indeed look at the WarrenCourt (which should have done more) and the long history of the Supreme Court (when it so often did far, far less).Again and again, he shows that it has sided with the powerful against the very people and principles it was designedto protect. He is at pains not to make this a liberal assault on the Court. Time and again, he gives examples thatpeople of all political persuasions can agree were poor choices of the Court. If he offers up red meat to the left, he'ssure to offer up red meat to the right with a counter example. As he explains the cases and the decisions made bythe Court from its early days to today, the case against the Supreme Court becomes compelling indeed, allpresented in clear and precise language any layperson can easily understand. Chemerinsky makes nonsense of theidea that judges are somehow impartial umpires rather than driven by ideology. And he offers practical steps thatwould improve the Court and its functions, everything from term limits to improving confirmation hearings to meritpanels that would recommend options for the President (an idea used around the world and by various statesincluding Alaska). Clearly Chemerinsky is passionate on liberal causes and makes no pretense otherwise. Yet thecase he makes about the Court's myriad failures is eye-opening to anyone who understands the Supreme Court canand should play a unique and vital role in our system of checks and balances. Chemerinsky has argued cases beforethe Court many times. But he ruffles so many feathers in that group of nine (and not just Scalia) that it's almost hardto imagine him appearing before them again after this passionate work comes out. If he does, it'll be worth campingout overnight just to get a ticket and watch. -- Michael GiltzLessWhat You SayFilter byNo Reviews Found .....</p>
