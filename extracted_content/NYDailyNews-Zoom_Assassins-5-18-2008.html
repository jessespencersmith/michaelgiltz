            <p>When life gets out of whack
ollywood loves assassins, even if they're usually a little messed up in
the head. That's why even John Cusack - one of the most likable actors
around - has played cold-blooded killers at least twice. In 1997s "crosse
Pointe Blank," Cusack was a multitasking hit man headed to his old
hometown for a job - while also taking time to attend his high-school reunion.
And in "War, Inc.," opening Friday, Cusack plays an assassin with issues
who's ordered to eliminate a Middle Eastem oil minister.
Here are other films where hit men (and women) deal with marital problems,
memory problems, mommy problems and even game-show problems.
THE BOURNE IDENTITY(2o,o.2>
Ilre targEt In this case, the target
is the killer himself. Jason Bourne
(an intense Matt Damon) is a rogue
agent with amnesia who stills knows
more than is good for him. And the
govemment wants him dead.
Bfs'qer The guy can
incapacitate someone with a ball-
point pen - do you really think a
stodgy govemment can nail him
down?
MR.ANDMRS.SMITH(200s)
The talg€t Couples therapy was
never this explosive. Angelina Jolie
and Brad Pitt play a bored married
duo who are both assassins - and
who don't realize they're each othefsmain competition until they're
ordered to off each other.
Btdl+eye: Bnngelina has been
togeffpr ever since this movie, the
biggest hit ofthe stars'careers. They've
adopted and had their own children
- but have yet to spawn a sequel.
THEMANCHURIAN
CANDfDATE(2OO4)
- Ite taryet Diabolical agents
(in the classic 1962 original, it
was Communists; here itb Big
Business) brainwash a war hero and
congressman (Liev Schreiber) into
serving as their on-call assassin. Plus,
Mom (Meryl Streep) is a U.S. senator
who is very, very fond of her son.
BulPs.eye: The good guys win
one, in a bleak sort of way, with a
mother-and-child reunion at thefinale brought r:rii
on by the
bullet of another
assassin. the not-
so-easily-duped Denzel''n
Washington.
THE BrG HrT0998)
fln targeft Hyper-polite Melvin
Smiley (a very tunny Mark Wahlberg)
uses his job as a killer to take his
mind off a pushy girlfriend and
another who's plain annoying.
&ls.€ile: Smiley, who's framed
for kidnapping a sexy schoolgirl, tries
to dump two girls and win the heart
of a third. Not difficult, since he's the
kind of guy who can return overdue
videotapes in the middle of a gunfight
PRfZZTS HONOR O98s)
Tln ta|gl€t: Ever complain about
your spouse not appreciating how
hard your job can be? That's exactly
how hit man Jack Nicholson and hit
woman lGthleen Turner feel when
they meet in a bar and spark fly.
BuFs.€Ue: Tempers flare when
each is ordered to kill the other. which
makes developing a relationship
problematic.PULPFICTION
oee4)
fhehrget Two hit
men (John Travolta and
Samuel L. Jackson) stop
at a diner after completing a
job and stumble upon a holdup.
Pop music, a gold watch, a needle
plunged into a chest and some cool
dancing ensue - not necessarily in
chronological order.
&ffs'e1e: Travolta sticks to his
plan of retiring (made after a guy
misses him repeatedly at point-blank
range) and Jackson frees the holdup
couple, though not before reciting a
fiery biblical passage one last time.
CONFESSIONSOFA
DANGEROUSMTND (2OO2).
flnta4et "The Gong Showg'
Chuck Barris (Sam Rockwell) is
absolutely fond of drugs, definitely a
globetrotting game-show host - and
possibly a trained CIA assassin.
BuFs.eye: lt's hard to tell if Barris
completes his mission, since we're not
even sure heb on a mission. But Gene
cene the Dancing Machine will be
there to comfort him with some nifty
moves no matter what.
