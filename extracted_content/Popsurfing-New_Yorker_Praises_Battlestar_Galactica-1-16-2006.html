But two things about theNancy Franklin review. She's clearly playing catch up -- the piecespends so much time recapping the miniseries that launched the show,it might as well have been written in 2003. And as a side note, shedescribes the SciFi channel's previous big success as "Mystery ScienceTheatre 3000." The wording is a little vague, so it may not technicallybe an error, but they certainly make it sound like MST3K is a signatureSciFi show when in fact it ran on Comedy Central for many years andSciFi dealt in the scraps when it began airing the show (with a newcast) some eight years into the run in 1997. That was also the year SciFilaunched "StarGate," now about to become the longest running sci-fihit in TV history. It's more of a signature series for the channel than"MST3K."POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
