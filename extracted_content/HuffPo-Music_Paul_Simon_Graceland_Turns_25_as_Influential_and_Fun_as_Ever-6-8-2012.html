<p>CD/DVD SET:  $15.98
LP: $24.98
Paul Simon's album Graceland  has turned 25 sounding better than ever. Its impact on music and culture
is vast, and any list of the best albums of all time looks silly if Graceland  doesn't appear on it somewhere.
The best selling solo album for an artist who continues to produce great music, Graceland  is a landmark
work. But not one that has grown dusty with Importance: It's not just a "significant" work with historical
meaning; it's also an exhilarating collection of songs as timeless and current as ever. This is the first of a
series covering the boxed set, its cultural impact, the story of the boycott and the music itself. You can
buy the album in any configuration from Paul Simon's website  or any major outlet.
Part One: The Boxed Set Review
Part Two: The Cultural Impact
Part Three: The Boycott
Part Four: The Album, Track By TrackGRACELAND: THE BOXED SET AND MORE
Graceland  is available in a newly remastered edition in various configurations. You can buy it as an LP
with a free digital download of the tracks, you can buy a CD/DVD set which contains the album and a
documentary film about the making of Graceland , or you can buy the deluxe set.
I am NOT a fan of bulky boxed sets, whether it's music, TV shows, or movies. I often wonder if thepeople who design them ever bring these things home. Where do they put them? I much prefer boxedsets that stay roughly within the dimensions of other DVDs or CDs so the boxed set -- even if it's a lot
thicker -- can fit on a shelf alongside all the others in my collection. Unless you have a big coffee table and
want to give a boxed set pride of place in your home, they just don't make sense. Heck, this deluxe boxed
set won't even fit on most of my bookcase shelves!
But when it arrived in the mail, I have to admit I broke into a grin. If the size of a boxed set is going to
reflect the importance of the work contained within, Graceland  could be two or three times its current
size as far as its impact on music and importance in my life. The hard shell is beautifully designed andcontains the full complement of stuff. You get a full-sized booklet with photos and liner notes and lyrics.You also get a fold-out display that contains a reproduction of the legal pad Simon originally wrote lyricsin as well as all four discs: the album, an extra CD with demo tracks and a 10 minute discussion of thealbum by Simon, the DVD of the documentary film Under African Skies  and the first DVD release of
Graceland: The African Concert  which was recorded in Zimbabwe in 1987.
I'm also a curmudgeon about exclusive bonus material (fans shouldn't have to remember to buy album A
at Best Buy and album B at WalMart to get extra stuff). But I will mention that if you buy the set on
Amazon you also get a third CD with five live tracks from the Graceland  tour recorded in Spain in 1989.
(The one thing missing for me? I've always wanted to hear the mixtape or album that obsessed Simon
and led to Graceland . Even after seeing the documentary it's unclear to me whether this was an album by
the Boyoyo Boys, a mix tape made by an individual, or an "official" compilation featuring them and otheracts. In any case, rights issues probably made it impractical, if anyone even considered it.)
The boxed set is beautifully designed on the outside and looks impressive. If you want to make a
statement, this does the job. The album, of course, sounds better than ever, with new, subtle detailsemerging from the remastering. The demos are interesting for completists but most people won't listen tothem more than once. The rest of the packaging has some downsides. The CDs and DVDs are held inawkward little "holes" (they're not quite slots) and are a little tricky to get in and out. The 76-page

<p>booklet of photos and liner notes is lovely. It contains a nice intro by Jesse Kornbluth and lyrics big
enough to read (a nice change of pace from CD booklets). But the bulk of the book contains an oralhistory of Graceland  and I'd say 70 percent of it repeats statements heard in the documentary film. I
assume the rest of the quotes are pulled from the interviews that didn't make the final cut. So once
you've seen the film, the bulk of the booklet feels repetitive.
Graceland: The African Concert is long overdue on DVD but it's more of a document than a satisfying
film on its own terms. The concert presented runs 90 minutes and contains the exact same set Simon and
the artists performed at Madison Square Garden on the tour, minus the encores of some Simon &
Garfunkel tunes. It's a perfectly acceptable souvenir but by no means a great concert film. I assume at
some point it will be available on its own.
The real attraction, of course, is Under African Skies , the documentary film by Joe Berlinger. He's a
talented director with little visual flair. Berlinger finds fascinating topics and explores them in a messy,
disorganized way. The journey is worth taking on his films, but it's not a disciplined one. Berlinger shineshere in letting Simon tell the full story of making the album and knowingly breaking the cultural boycotton South Africa called for by the African National Congress. His critics at the time are graciously given
their full due and eventually the entire back-and-forth becomes clear.
Mixed in with this political tempest are shots of Simon reuniting with many of the people who played on
the album and rehearsing songs with them. Here Berlinger's visual limits are most evident -- musicians
jam for a while before we even get a sense of the space they're in and how they're positioned next to each
other. And as Simon himself has pointed out, these are early rehearsals and the shows themselves will be
much tighter. Ultimately, Under African Skies  gets the job done and is far and away the most interesting
extra available timed to the 25th anniversary of the album. It is not a classic the way the making-of about
Bridge Over Troubled Waters  has proven to be in a deluxe set released just last year to celebrate its 40th
anniversary (!) but it's something Simon fans will certainly enjoy.
So that's the boxed set: beautiful but oversized, awkward for holding the actual discs (like a surprising
number of boxed sets, frankly) with a very good making-of documentary, a decent concert, and the usualbonus material. It has many pluses and minuses but the money is on display. For most fans, I think theCD/DVD set is a no-brainer. You get the new documentary DVD and the bonus tracks of demos andSimon discussing the album. It's slightly larger than a standard CD (6 by 5.5 inches) but most shelvesshould just about accommodate it. The LP, of course, is for the audiophiles who can't give up theirturntables. I envy them getting to sit down and listen to the album while looking at that iconic cover.Maybe that's why my eyes lit up on seeing the boxed set: those of us used to CDs or even digital-onlyalbums rarely get the chance to see graphics life-sized and in living color anymore.
Tomorrow: Graceland: Its Cultural Impact.
Until then, enjoy the official video for "The Boy In The Bubble," the great opening track on the album.

When I'm heading out on a road trip alone, Graceland is always one of the CD's that comes along. I
have loved Paul Simon since I was a teenager (many, many moons ago) and his work never
ceases to please me. Thanks for this review of the boxed set.

I have always thought that this was one of the top ten albums ever recorded, a true example of how
music can be influential and satisfying on many cultural levels. Great post. Thanks!

Was at my son' s graduation at cal poly San Luis Obispo. Graceland , the whole album was playedin the stadium of 9000 or more persons, before ceremony began. It was a great choice, one of the
best albums of the past century.

Great review. " Graceland The African Concert" has long been available on DVD though {Warner ]. I
have had a copy for a long time. Paul Simon fans have long wanted the Concert in the Park 1991issued as a DVD. Agree about the discs being awkward to extract
12:52 AM on 06/09/2012
Hi Brenda,Thanks for commenting. Perhaps The African Concert has been available overseas? TheWB press release says this is the first DVD release of the title. And looking online before I
posted the review, I saw just a few DVDs costing hundreds of dollars at resellers and the
VHS also wildly expensive. Was your version a US release DVD? Press releases havebeen known to be wrong before, of course. I was at the Concert In the park in 1991, whichwas great fun though my favorite Paul Simon show was at the Beacon a little while afterthat. Hope you keep reading the series on Graceland and keep commenting.

Hi Michael. Thank you for replying. I did purchase my dvd in Australia at JB Hi Fi.Cost $21.99 in 2009. released by Warner Bros in Australia. But it was alsoreleased in the USA too. According to this Amazon link on March 23 1999. under
product details it states Region 1 {USA and Canada} and the format is NTSC I
know it is very rare now ,hence the price. I guess the press release was wrong.Lucky you to have been at the Concert In The Park!
