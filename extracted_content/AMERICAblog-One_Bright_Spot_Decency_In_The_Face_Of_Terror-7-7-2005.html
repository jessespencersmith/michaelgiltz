7/07/2005 10:58:00 AMIt's amazing to me how decent and humane we can remain inthe face of terror. I'm watching CNN and a panel of policetaking questions. DAC Brian Paddick is one of them -- he's themost senior out gay officer in the UK police force and a hero tomany in the GLBT community. Someone asked a questionabout "Islamic terrorists" and Paddick actually took a momentto denounce the very idea. He said that anyone who is aterrorist can hardly claim to be a Muslim, since attackinginnocent people is counter to the very beliefs of Islam. (I'd saythe same about "Christian terrorists" like Eric Rudolph et al.)This right after dozens are killed and hundreds are injured.He's not just being politic -- words like that can keep angrypeople from taking revenge on the innocent UK citizens whoare Islamic.It reminds me of how the US ran public serve ads after 9-11with celebrities and politicians distinguishing between proudAmerican citizens who are muslims and the terrorists. It's aremarkable sign of our strength and decency -- somethingyou'd NEVER see from the corrupt govts of the Middle East orcertainly from Al Quaeda. (Can you imagine Al Quaedabroadcasting a message after a US bombing that Islamicpeople should distinguish between the US govt and its people?Of course not. They paint all Westerners as decadent andworthy of death.) It's one sign of why we will ultimately prevailin the face of such evil.P.S. Having been riding on those tube lines just weeks ago,having a sister in London who rides the buses (she's fine), thisfeels very personal to me. The British are sadly used toterrorism, thanks to the IRA. They won't be cowed by this.
