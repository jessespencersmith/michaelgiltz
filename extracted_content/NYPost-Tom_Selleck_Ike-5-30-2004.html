• GETTING PERSONAL 
Tom Selleck earns his wings 
By MICHAEL GILTZ (( f)o/ u~ 
TOM Selleck can identify with 
General Dwight D. Eisenhow­
er, the Allied Commander who 
had the overwhelming responsibili­
ty of organizing D-Day. 
"What got to me in playing Ike," 
says Selleck, 59, who plays the 
beloved war hero in A&E's "Ike: 
Countdown to D-Day" on Monday 
night, "was the sheer load of it. He 
was never dealing with one problem 
at once. All he had to do was turn 
his head and someone else was 
coming to him with something else. 
If it wasn't the weather, it was any 
number of other things." 
Surely Selleck understands that 
constant demand for attention: his 
career hasn't been this hot since he 
catapulted to stardom in 1980 as the 
mustachioed Vietnam vet turned 
private eye on "Magnum P.!''' 
(a role that famously cost 
him the lead in 1981's 
'"Raiders of the Lost Ark"). 
Last week he starred in 
CBS' two-part TV movie 
"Reversible Errors" oppo­
site William H. Macy. His 
Emmy-nominatcd stint on 
·'Friends" proved he could be \' 
as adroIt with comedy as he is 
with drama. A string of West-
erns on TNT, among them 
2001's "Crossfue Trail," have set cable ratings records. CBS 
just announced his new project 
"The Culpepper Cattle Company" 
as one of its premiere TV movies 
for the fall. 
And tomorrow night comes "Ike," 
a look at the arduous buildup to D­
Day, one of the most complex, disas­
ter-fraught enterprises in military 
history. It co-stars Timothy Bottoms 
as his chief of staff and Gerald 
McRaney as George S. Patton. His­
tory can seem inevitable in retro­
spect -of course, the Allied 
Armies defeated Hitler -but Sell­
eck hopes this movie ("It's not a 
docudrama" he says repeatedly) can 
show viewers the very real risks 
involved and why they had to be 
taken. 
"This stuff is so hard, from an 
ordinary soldier's point of view," 
says Selleck, who is mar­
ried to the actress 
Jillie Mack (she 
appeared in a 
few episodes 
of "Mag­
num") and 
with whom 
he has one 
daughter. "It's 
so hard from a 
command point 
of view. If we 
hadn't invaded 
France and taken 
huge risks, it's quite 
possible -even 
From 
cowboys to 
Eisenhower: 
Selleck though Germany was on the defen­
sive by then ~ they could have sued 
ror peace and· we could have had a 
Nazi-dominated Europe. It's also 
possible D-Day could have failed." 
Selleck knew why A&E wanted 
him for the role -his TNT movies 
had been huge critical and commer­
cial hits. The morning after "Cross­
fire Trail" aired, the network called 
to say it was going to wait a day 
before putting out a press release, 
and Selleck figured the numbers 
just weren't that good. 
In fact, the numbers were too 
good. TNT was so stunned by the 
figure - a record 9.6 that made 
'"Crossfire Trail" far and away the 
highest rated, basic-cable movie in 
history -that they wanted to triple 
check it before making any boasts. 
"Ever since then, I've always had a 
Western in development," says Sell­
eck, "and I've always known it will 
get made." 
Given that track record, it's easy to 
see why Selleck didn't quite see him­
self as Ike. Lionel Chetwynd, the 
writer and producer of the project, 
convinced the actor that he had the 
right sort of screen aura - a certain 
decency that has served him well 
when he played cowboys. Then he 
plunged into the role. He knew he 
didn't want to do an imitation, but 
watching some footage proved 
immensely useful. 
"One show that helped me a lot 
was this TV program [where] Wal­
ter Cronkite! walked the beaches of 
Normandy with Eisenhower and just 
taIked and asked him questions," 
says SellecK.' They shared a rare 
moment 'of unguarded emotions. 
"Eisenhower was an old man, and 
that generation didn't wear its heart 
on its sleever -he says. 
"Ike" is a far cry from Selleck's 
brief appearance. in the 1976 military 
drama "Midway." 
"Wanna know my favorite line 
from that?" laughs Selleck, who 
played a military aide. ''After 
they bomb the field in Mid­
way, we come out to look and 
I say, 'God, they creamed us!'" 
He finally gets to have his 
military victory in "Ike." The 
three-hour movie leads up to 
that fateful day and Selleck 
zeroes in on one moment that 
defmed the heavy respsonsibility 
Ike had to shoulder. 
"When he ordered airborne troops 
in bad weather to do a close drop 
behind German lines, Ike was look­
ing at seven-out-of-lO dead," says 
Selleck. "When he gave that order, 
he went to the airfield and met them 
and put on a happy face and shook 
their hands. It's the one time people 
say when he walked away from those 
troops -:certainly not in front of 
them -m,d ~e,l¥td tears in his eyes."
