            <p>The waiting is the hardest part 
_BY' MICHAEL GILTZ 
. The summer is half over and Hollywood 
is still waiting for a ruii-away blockbuster 
or surprise hit to catch audiences -and 
t em -by surprise . Big-ticket items such 
as Total Recall and Days of Thunder have 
t~ gross $100 miHion just to remain respect­
able. But a number of upcoming movies 
could do just as well and be Gonsidered ' 
great successes. 
The just-released Ghost is a prime candidate for 
unexpected boxcoffice action. It's peopled by three 
B-grade movie stars: Demi Moore, Whoopi 
Goldberg and Patrick Swayze, who's consider ed a 
fluke and hasn't proven anyone wrong with Road­
house and Next Of Kin. But there's enough of an 
industry and audience buzz around this 
mystery/comedy/supernatural-romance to turn it 
into a hit. 
Several other films -such as Arachnophobia and 
Problem Child hope to follow in its footsteps . The 
following is a rundown of movies scheduled for 
release in the next six weeks and their chances of 
doing big business. Remember, all dates are subject 
to change. 
Arachnophobia JULY 20: 
Arachnophobia , 
a comedy 
thriller about a 
suburban home 
overrun by 
giant spiders, 
stars the ami­
able Jeff 
Daniels and 
John Goodman. 
It's backed by Steven Spielberg, and the trailer looks 
good. Prepare to be scared. 
. _ Steve Martin stars as a tacky FBI informant who 
gets transplanted by the Witness Protection Program 
to suburbia in My Blue Heaven. He has to deal with 
a nebbish government contact (Rick Moranis) and 
white-bread America . Screenwriter Nora Ephron 
(When 'Harry Met Sally ... ) is hot, and Martin is 
always funny. Should do good, but not great, busi­
ness. 
Charlie Sheen stars in Naval Seals, an action flick 
about -an elite naval combat and rescue team. He 
must have the same agent as Nicholas Cage, who 
appeared in the' Top Gun-like clinker Fire Birds 
earlier this summer. Seals should sink without a 
trace. 
Ford stars in 
this court-room 
thriller based

Flatliners. 
Director Joel 
COLUMBIA Schumacher 
Flatliners has a knack . for commer-
cial projects and the cast is top-loaded with pretty 
woman Julia Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland . The 
long trailer is also a doozy, so look for this one to 
score strongly. 
AUGUST 3: Spike Lee's highly anticipated Mo' 
Better Blues looks at the jazz world in the form of 
a drama starring Denzel Washington. Everyone of 
Lee's films has had a bigger budget and has done 
better at the box 
office than the 
one before it. This 
will ~e no excep­
tion. 
Ducktales: The 
Movie is a spin­
off from the wild­
ly successful 
syndicated show. 
Scrooge McDuck 
and his nephews 
go searching for Mo' Better Blues 
buried treasure, but only the kiddies and their 
parents will tag along. 
AUGUST 10: The much-delayed sequel to 
Chinatown will finally see the light of day when The 
Two Jakes premieres next month. Jack Nicholson 
returns as Jake Gittes and even directs. It's release 
date has been changed so often that the movie is 
probably not the winner Paramount was hoping for. 
Remember, screenwriter Robert Towne is brilliant,

screenplay for Days

Another darkhorse 
is Darkman , set to be 
released sometime in 
mid-August. It's a 
Phantom of the Opera­
type thriller that is 
getting a big push 
from Universal. 
Also look for Graf­
fiti Bridge, Prince's 
another clinker star­
ring Charlie Sheen. 
This one's about two 
garbage men who 
Finally, we can all look forward to The Freshman, 
a comedy starring Matthew Broderick about a film 
school student who gets a job working for Mafia don 
Marlon Brando. Brando disowned the picture short­
ly after it wrapped and publicly claimed he was 
retiring for good, but hated to end with a stinker. 
He later changed his mind and said that The Fresh­
man is obviously a fine film and "contains moments
