8/11/2004 08:21:00 PM"Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge said Tuesday that thegovernment is moving quickly to create a computerized screeningsystem that will check airline passengers against lists of suspectedterrorists," per USA Today.Moving quickly??????Blame falls on Clinton and Bush Sr. and Reagan and Carter and backinto the mists of time. But this is ridiculous. I thought it was absurdwhen I found after 9/11 that airports couldn't check against updatedterrorist watch lists. Three years after that attack on our soil, I find itfrightening and infuriating. I know there are difficult technical issues.But three years? That's absurd.
