9/12/2005 12:35:00 PMBush was crowing loudly when the Republican-controlledCongress made draconian changes to the bankruptcy laws thatput the screws on the middle class and poor. One out of 4people who declare bankruptcy do so because of catastrophicillness and out of control medical bills. But Bush made itinfinitely harder for them to get a clean slate and a fresh start.The wealthy, of course, can afford the lawyers to avoid taxesand use bankruptcy to their advantage.Those new bankruptcy laws go into effect IN A FEW WEEKS.How is Bush going to face those millions of people uprootedand financially devastated and look them in the eye and say,Screw you? I hope the MSM starts doing stories on the peopledevastated and how the new bankruptcy laws make their livesinfinitely more difficult. When is Bush going to urge Congressrepeal the new bankruptcy laws? Or has he no heart?
