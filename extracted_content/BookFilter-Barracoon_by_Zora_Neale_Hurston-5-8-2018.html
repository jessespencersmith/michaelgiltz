The Story of the Last "Black Cargo"
by Zora Neale Hurston, Deborah G. Plant
Price: $24.99 (Hardcover)
Published: May 08, 2018
Rating: 0.0/ 5 (0 votes cast)
From the Publisher: A major literary event: a never-before-published
work from the author of the American classic Their Eyes Were WatchingGod that brilliantly illuminates the horror and injustices of slavery as it
tells the true story of one of the last known survivors of the Atlantic slave
trade—abducted from Africa on the last "Black Cargo" ship to arrive in the
United States. In 1927, Zora Neale Hurston went to Plateau, Alabama, justoutside Mobile,  to interview eighty-six-year-old Cudjo Lewis. Of the
millions of men, women, and children transported from Africa to America
as slaves, Cudjo was then the only person alive to tell the story of this
integral part of the nation’s history. Hurston was there to record Cudjo’sfirsthand account of the raid that led to his capture and bondage fiftyyears after the Atlantic slave trade was outlawed in the United States. In1931, Hurston returned to Plateau, the African-centric community three
miles from Mobile founded by Cudjo and other former slaves from his ship.
Spending more than three months there, she talked in depth with Cudjoabout the details of his life. During those weeks, the young writer and theelderly once enslaved man ate peaches and watermelon that grew in the
backyard and talked about Cudjo’s past—memories from his childhood in
Africa, the horrors of being captured and held in a barracoon for selectionby American slavers, the harrowing experience of the Middle Passagepacked with more than 100 other souls aboard the Clotilda , and the years
he spent in slavery until the end of the Civil War. Based on those
interviews, featuring Cudjo’s unique vernacular, and written from
Hurston’s perspective with the compassion and singular style that havemade her one of the preeminent American authors of the twentieth-century, Barracoon  brilliantly illuminates the tragedy of slavery and of one
life forever defined by it. Offering insight into the pernicious legacy thatcontinues to haunt us all, black and white, this poignant and powerfulwork is an invaluable contribution to our shared history and culture.

What We Say
This singular work of biography, cultural history and witnessing reminds us that writer Zora Neale Hurston was not just a
brilliant author but also an ethnographer and esteemed collector of folk tales. This book shows her the respect of detailing
the genesis of "Barracoon" (both good and ill) while providing the historical context essential to such a document. Hurstonwent to Alabama to speak with a man known as Cudjo Lewis, but whom she respectfully calls Kossola. He was almostunique among once enslaved people -- Kossola was able to tell his story from life in Africa to the Middle Passage toenslavement in the US and freedom after the Civil War, right on down to the injustice meted out to black people long after
their freedom was first dangled as a possibility. That journey is preserved here by an empathetic listener. "Barracoon" also
documents the plagiarism that Hurston's initial piece about Kossola contained, keeping it in the context of why and how itmight have occurred and how it never appeared again throughout her lengthy and distinguished career. Then comes themain narrative that Hurston captured after returning to Alabama and spending months nearby, slowly winning Kossola's trust
and thus gathering essential details rarely if ever captured. Footnotes explain certain claims Hurston made with the best
available information at the time and why scholars now make new judgements in certain areas and confirm her judgementin others. Hurston told Lewis's story in his voice and went to great lengths to back it up with facts from other sources; thatwork continues here. His journey is an atypical "slave narrative," explaining the warring peoples in Africa and how one groupmight sell another into bondage. (Are we surprised that England and France warred for centuries and often despised each
other? So why is it surprising in Africa? It too is a continent filled with diverse civilizations, after all.) Kossola's mournful,
sometimes humorous voice comes through, along with Hurston's passion for the stories he digresses into, not to mention thecruelty of the court system and life in general for black people long after Reconstruction was abandoned by the governmentand betrayed by the South. It is not a gripping story the way many slave narratives are, with their dramatic beats, heroicescapes and triumphs over evil crafted to win sympathy. This is history, with all its complications and refusal to tie up a
story in a neat bow. It won't satisfy the casual reader looking for thrills. But it's an important addition to the work of
Hurston and our knowledge of the lives uprooted by the slave trade. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
“Zora Neale Hurston’s genius has once again produced a Maestrapiece.” (Alice Walker, Pulitzer Prize winning
author of The Color Purple ) “That Zora Neale Hurston should find and befriend Cudjo Lewis, the last living manwith firsthand memory of capture in Africa and captivity in Alabama, is nothing shy of a miracle. Barracoon is atestament to the enormous losses millions of men, women and children endured in both slavery and freedom—astory of urgent relevance to every American, everywhere.” (Tracy K. Smith, Pulitzer Prize winning author of Life
on Mars and Wade in the Water ) “Barracoon reinforces what those of us who love Hurston’s work have known
all along: her keen intellect and curiosity was only surpassed by her genuine empathy for her subjects. This bookis not just an account of one man’s survival in the face of atrocity, it’s a celebration of language and tradition; aclear labor of love.” (Angela Flournoy, National Book Award Finalist and author of The Turner House) “Barracoonis a powerful, breathtakingly beautiful, and at times, heart wrenching, account of one man’s story, eloquentlytold in his own language. Zora Neale Hurston gives Kossola control of his narrative— a gift of freedom andhumanity. It completely reinforces for me the fact that Zora Neale Hurston was both a cultural anthropologistand a truly gifted, and compassionate storyteller, who sat in the sometimes painful silence with Kossola and thedepth and breadth of memory as a slave. Such is a narrative filled with emotions and histories bursting at theintricately woven seams.” (Nicole Dennis-Benn, author of Here Comes the Sun)
