A drinker, ascrappy player, a fighter and undeniably at the center of the Bronx Zoo, Martin made great coy for sports writersthroughout his career. But above all he was a passionate winner. Pennington is a New York Times reporter whocovered the Yankees during the dark days of the mid-80s through 1990 and he delivers the sprawling, epic taleMartin's career deserves in an biography that Publishers Weekly calls "a must-read for fans of the greatAmerican pastime."MIRACLE AT AUGUSTA By James Patterson & Peter de Jonge $28.00; Little Brown and CompanyAnyone looking to lose themselves in a book can depend on the latest offering from the shockingly prolificJames Patterson. Working with Peter de Jonge, he returns to the links to deliver a golfing fable about a late inlife champion on the Senior Tour who finds true redemption by mentoring a teen with a natural swing that's athing of beauty.

Or a cynical realization that they needArod to perform at least decently if the Yankees are to have any (slim) hope of slipping into the post-season?Whatever the case, they might all enjoy the painful facts in Blood Sport, a widely praised look at the steroid eraby reporters/editors from the Miami News Times and Newsday, rspectively. It's clear-eyed, sobering and ariveting read for anyone who thinks steroids is no big problem or some of the players got a raw deal from themedia and baseball's front office. Oh and it's funny in an awful sort of way, with critics comparing it to atelenovela and the comic novels of Carl Hiaasen.For more great picks in books about sports, head here.
