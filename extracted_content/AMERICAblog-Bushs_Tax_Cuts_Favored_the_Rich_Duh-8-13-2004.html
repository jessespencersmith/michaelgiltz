8/13/2004 01:01:00 AMIt seems obvious, but hopefully the Congressional Budget Office'sclear analysis that Bush's tax cuts were heavily weighted towards therich will gain traction. One-third of the entire tax cut went to the top1%. Two-thirds went to people making more than $200,000. Bush'speople lamely say, "See, this proves everyone benefits sinceeveryone gained a little." But if you save $20 on your taxes andsomeone in the top 1% saves $2 million, well that's the verydefinition of a poorly targeted tax cut. I'm all for smaller tax cuts foreveryone (just because someone is successful in business is noreason to soak them). And the government will spend every pennyyou give it. But when you're trying to stimulate the economy andthere is massive overall debt (as opposed to the massive annualdeficits Bush brought back into fashion), then stealing from the poor(by cutting the social programs that could help lift them out ofpoverty) and giving to the rich is a terrible idea.
