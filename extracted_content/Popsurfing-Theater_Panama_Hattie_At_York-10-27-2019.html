THEATER: Stuff and Nonsense for Friendly
Crowds -- "Iolanthe" and "Panama Hattie"
PANAMA  HATTIE  ** out of ****
YORK  THEATRE  COMPANY
IOLANTHE  ** out of ****
NYGASP  AT KAYE  PLAYHOUSE  AT  HUNTER  COLLEGE
Sometimes a show isn't very good. Sometimes the performances are
mostly...enthusiastic. Yet in the right context and with the right crowd,a fine time can be had.
First up: Panama  Hattie,  a (much) lesser Cole Porter vehicle for Ethel
Merman from 1940. It's the final production of the York Theatre's
season devoted to "mufti" performances of three Porter shows. That is,staged readings presented casually in street clothes so you can get asense of what rarely seen shows are actually like.
It's been a good season. The musical Fifty  Million  Frenchmen  has a
superior score and clutch of songs they did right by. With a tightened
(or new) book, you could put it on commercially. The revue Declineand  Fall...  is a signal work from the 1960s well worth revisiting. It
could and perhaps should have extended -- no changes needed.
And now this military-loving, flag-waving bit of nonsense. It's not
good and thus it's precisely the sort of show that should  be presented
in this way. The movie bears little resemblance to the play and ditchedmost of the songs. The original score has never been recorded. The
stage version will never be revived commercially, so you won't see it
any other way
So the York deserves plaudits for putting on this evening, giving
people a chance to see the entire book (filled with romance, terrorism,
American sailors, British butlers and so on), hear the modest scoreMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>and get a sense of how rote Broadway could be two years before
Oklahoma!  upended everything but good.
With about five minutes of rehearsal time and script firmly in hand,the game cast offered it up. Under those circumstances, it's only kindto single out the pluses. As a kid who intimidates the Ethel Mermancharacter, Kylie Kuioka was a teensy bit cute. But what a pro! She
knew her every line and probably knew everyone else's as well. Kuikoa
might have left her script backstage for all she needed it. In ten years,she'll be directing. As the butler-besotted Florrie, Anita Welch hadpersonality to spare and a strong voice.

But it's an Ethel Merman vehicle and all that mattered was the lead.
Klea Blackhurst (who knows from Merman) was more than up to the
task. Without her on stage, staging Panama  Hattie  would felt more
like exhuming it. But Blackhurst lifted the evening up. She belted outsongs, she charmed everyone and when something went awry (like
losing her place in a song or losing her bracelet when it flew into the
audience), Blackhurst made the most of it. (My favorite line: whenspeaking about a villainous woman trying to scuttle her romance,Hattie says, "I'd like to see her surrounded by six silver handles.") Justlike Merman all those years ago, Blackhurst took some hoary material
and convinced us it was a treat to perform. The audience ate it up.
Then there's NYGASP, more properly known as the New York Gilbert
& Sullivan Players. For 45 years, they've kept the flame alive for thecomic operettas of G&S. Sure, you and I might be able to name the Big
Three (
The  Pirates  Of  Penzance,  H.M.S.  Pinafore,  The  Mikado ), but
NYGASP and their enthusiastic audience can name them all, plus their"Find Me"

<p>plots and the best numbers. Just try them.
I always pictured this troupe as a cross between amateur theatricals
and a Met opera production of a war horse -- one of those verytraditional and very familiar stagings the Met trots out with newer
talent to get some ka-ching at the box office. And what do you know?
That's precisely how it seemed to me. The staging is so faithful andtraditional you'll think you've slipped back in time.
The large ensemble is filled with very enthusiastic performers and a
few ringers in the lead roles. The set is spot-on and could have beenlifted from Topsy-Turvy.  The one shining exception is the large and
very impressive orchestra, which is conducted by Albert Bergeret, the
company's founder, artistic director and general manager. The
musicianship would do Broadway proud. That aside, if you werestationed in India when the British Empire was in full force and thelocals staged G&S, the vibe of this Iolanthe  is exactly what you'd
expect to see.
You get the strong feeling the audience is revisiting old friends, by
which I mean G&S, Iolanthe  and the actors on stage, all of whom are
undoubtedly familiar to them over the years. That camaraderie andsense of people picking out their favorites extends to the main role ofthe Lord Chancellor, played by crowd favorite James Mills. He's playedevery role possible and when not on stage he's stage managing,
handling tech and so on. Mills delivered up "Love, unrequited, robs
me of my rest" with aplomb...all four times. Just to prove myignorance, I only knew the song from Mandy Patinkin's solo debut,with not a clue where it came from.
Lifting up proceedings appreciably was Angela Christine Smith as the
Fairy Queen and David Macaluso as the romantic lead Strephon. Theyexcelled in both singing and acting, a rarity. But no cavils. Is it anysurprise the Executive Director David Wannen both intro'd the show
and popped into a small role as the strapping Private Willis? Not at
all! (Even less so when you note he has some of the best creditsbeyond G&S.) Are veterans of NYGASP certain to shed a tear overLaurelyn Watson Chase, giving her final performance as the company'sleading soprano? Of course they will.
Mounted for two nights only, Iolanthe  and everything presented by
NYGASP is a pure labor of love. That's true of anyone working in
theater, but doubly so for G&S-ers. While London can boast ofmultiple companies devoted to their repertoire and at least the
possibility of the occasional commercial production, here NYGASP is
the only game in town. If, like me, you yearn to actually see theseshows rather than just read about them, you'll come with a generousspirit. It's all stuff and nonsense.   And sometimes that's exactly what
you need.►  June (3)
