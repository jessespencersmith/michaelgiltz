The Village 
** Buena Vista, $29.99 
Deride his "Twilight Zone" 
surprises if you must, but 
director M. Night Shyamalan has 
a gift for creating images 
pregnant with portent. "The 
Village" would have been far 
more interesting by telling its 
secrets upfront. But a fine cast 
Oed by Joaquin Phoenix and 
Bryce Dallas Howard) does its 
best and no one since Hitchcock 
can make an empty field seem 
more menacing. Modest extras, 
including deleted scenes and a 
diary by Howard. 
Silver City *** Columbia TriStar, $24.96 
It's clear director John Sayles 
has the respect of his fellow 
artists: year after year, actors line 
up to be in his films. His pointed 
political satire "Silver City" 
features Chris Cooper, Kris 
KI:istofferson, Richard ~reyfuss, 
Mlguel Ferrer, Thora Blrch, 
Daryl Hannah, Maria Bello, Tim 
Roth and Mary Kay Place -
enough talent to make even 
Robert Altman get a little jealous. 
Fighting Elegy **1/2 
Criterion, $29.95 
This 1966 Japanese B-movie 
about a teen boy lusting after 
a prim girl proves one thing at Monk: 
Season 
Two *** Universal, $59.98 
Heres a mystery ne 
one has solved yet: the 
disappearancE' 01 
actress Bitty Schram 
after three years on the 
series "Monk" Fans of 
her character, Sharona, 
can take solace with 
the appearance of the 
complete second 
season from this 
Emmy-winning comic 
series about a 
detective with 
obsessive compulsive 
disorder. Also out: 
"MI-5: Volume Two" 
(BBC Video, $79.98). 
the UK.'s answer to' 
"24.H 
least: casting actors in their 
20s to play teenagers wasn't 
just an American fad from the 
'50s through "Grease" -it 
apparently happened all over 
the world. Far more typical of 
director Seijun Suzuki is the 
violent, over-the-top 1963 
yakuza picture "Youth of the 
Beast" (Criterion, $29.95), 
Gilligan's Island: 
Second 
Season/Hercules: 
Season Five **1/2 each 
Warner Bros., $39.98/ 
Anchor Bay, $69.98 
The reality spin on 
"Gilligan's Island" was a 
surprising hit. But if you want 
to put your brain on hold for a I 
few hours, stick with the 
slapstick original or better 
yet, Kevin Sorbo battling 
mythic creatures in 
"Hercules."</p>
