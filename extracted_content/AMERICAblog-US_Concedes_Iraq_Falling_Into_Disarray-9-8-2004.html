9/08/2004 01:38:00 AMWho said Iraq was always going to be a positive for Bush? In thelatest news, the US finally admits the reality of what is happening inIraq: rebels/insurgents/terrorists/religious fanatics/patriots orwhatever you wanna call them are taking increasing control of majorchunks of Iraq.This comes after the US death toll goes above 1,000 and attacks onour troops there have shot up almost 400% from 700 in March to2,700 in August. Force in dealing with these insurgents is of coursealways an option. But US military officials thought they might hold offon that for say, oh, I don't know, maybe two months which --wouldn't you know -- would mean until after the US elections.As the New York Times pointed out,"A two-month hiatus before major force is applied to rebel areaswould also mean a delay until after the American presidentialelection, but senior officials insist there is no domestic politicalcalculus in the decision to wait - only a conviction that time is neededfor negotiation and for Iraqi forces to gain strength."Uh-huh. One more sign of US desperation: local residents sayinsurgents control the city of Samarra but US commanders say thatisn't true, claiming that "the messages at Friday prayer are becomingmore and more moderate." Military officials having to characterize thetenor of Friday prayers is a sad sign indeed.
