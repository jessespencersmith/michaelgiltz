            <p>DVDs:  Horrible  Hobbit ,  Great  Day-
Lewis,  Treacly  Life  of  Pi   and  More
Oscar  Faves  Hit  Stores
A flood of Oscar winners, nominees and those that should have been hit stores in the last
few weeks. Here's a rundown of recent new films that have just debuted on DVD and
BluRay.
THE  HOBBIT:  AN  UNEXPECTED
JOURNEY  ($35.99 BluRay combo;
MGM/Warner Bros.) -- The  Hobbit  will go
down in history as the first film releasedcommercially in 48 fps, an innovation that will
soon jump probably to 64 fps or some other
standard but which may very well become as
common as color and sound is today. The 3-Dhowever, remains a gimmick that will soon fadeagain except for big blockbuster films thatsomehow justify the cost for their thrill rides.Sadly, these are the most important detailsabout The  Hobbit.  I loved The  Lord  of  the  Rings
trilogy and consider it a landmark filmachievement and easily one of the greatestfantasy works of all time. The  Hobbit  is as
complete a fall from grace as Star  Wars:  The
Phantom  Menace  was from the original George Lucas trilogy, right down to the annoying
minor character inserted for comic relief and to amuse the kiddies (Jar Jar Binks in one,Radagast the Brown in the other). I watched it in both formats (3-D and 2-D) in thetheaters but don't think I can bring myself to watch it a third time and detail the manyjaw-droppingly bad artistic choices, from the video game chase in the realm of the GreatGoblin to having Thorin hug Bilbo with all the gusto of a guest on "Dr. Phil." And I couldrattle off the dwarves in order of their arrival at Bag End. The extras are voluminous andthe movie is presented with care, though doubtless you'll be enticed by even more bonusfeatures once all three films are released. I'll see them all but I'm not looking forward toit. Nothing in 2012 disappointed me more.
LINCOLN  ($39.99 BluRay combo;
DreamWorks/FOX) -- What a remarkableperformance by Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln,though to call it a performance is already tocheapen his accomplishment. You simply watchthe film and wonder how they got Lincoln onthe set. Day-Lewis captures an idea of Lincolnwith complexity, warmth and intelligence. It's apity his work is wasted on a rather routineperiod drama. The middle section is a betterthan average episode of The  West  Wing  as
Lincoln and his compatriots push for the
passage of the 13th Amendment. (That's aMay 7, 2014

<p>compliment, by the way.) The flag-waving,
pointless introduction, the condescendingappearances by totems of African-American
respectability and the pointlessly drawn-out
final act of the film that trudges through the end of the war and (spoiler alert!) Lincoln's
assassination all spoil the modest pleasures in the middle. Day-Lewis created a livingbreathing person; director Steven Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner immediatelyembalm him in piety.
RUST  AND  BONE  ($35.99 BluRay; Sony
Pictures Classics) -- An art house favorite, Rustand  Bone  is essentially a woman's picture, a
weepie about a heroine who overcomes tragedyto triumph, namely an accident that leaves herparalyzed. That's the rough outline, though youalmost don't realize it while watching the filmbecause it's made with such maturity andcomplexity by the great French director JacquesAudiard. Marion Cotillard and MatthiasSchoenaerts are superb as the woman facing alife-changing blow and the man who has notime for self-pity. Adult fare in the best sense.
LES
MISERABLES  ($34.99 BluRay combo; Universal) -- Oh dear. Les  Miserables  the
musical has never been treated kindly by critics. It opened to poor reviews in London butaudiences flocked immediately and it became a worldwide sensation. I've seen the musicalseveral times and love the score, though the subsequent work by the creators has been</p>
<p>almost universally dreadful (including Miss  Saigon ) and gives me pause. This film version
won't help matters, since the casting in classic Hollywood style has been done to maximize
star power and minimize singing ability. It's a musical, for heaven's sake! One major actorwho can charm and talk-sing their way through a part? Fine. But this version has wall towall stars who simply can't do justice to the roles, including Russell Crowe, Sacha BaronCohen, Helena Bonham Carter, and, yes, Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman. Most ofthem can't sing. Hathaway gets by and seems the shining star compared to the rest but Ican't imagine anyone listening to a real Broadway star belting out "I Dreamed a Dream"
and preferring Hathaway. (Cue the comments.) Jackman is a very appealing performer
whose on-stage magnetism has never remotely been captured on film. I'd love to see him
in Pal  Joey  or numerous other shows. But he has a light, pleasant voice when Jean
Valjean demands a Wotan of massive, belting power. But you could have the best singers
in the world and it wouldn't matter when director Tom Hooper seemed determined to
shoot the film in haphazard style with TV-like close-ups dominating what should be an
epic film. Instead of satisfying me, it makes me long for the new Broadway production
coming in 2014 so I can hear real singers belt out those songs once again.
ZERO  DARK  THIRTY  ($40.99 BluRay
combo; Sony) -- This isn't an authorized workbut you wouldn't know it from the hagiographyat work here. Our heroine seems to be the onlyone in government who is not a dunce headand remains focused like a laser on capturingOsama Bin Laden. Those criticizing the film forits politics are surely misguided -- whatever theorder of scenes, the movie is clearly reachingfor a moral complexity about how the war andmanhunt were implemented. This is no rah-rah,ain't torture grand movie. For all its flaws, ithas an intelligence and scope that keep themovie watchable. Jessica Chastain holds ittogether ably as the driven intelligenceoperative though Jason Clarke is the one that
stayed with me.
THIS  MUST  BE  THE  PLACE  ($29.99
BLURAY; Anchor Bay) -- What an oddballdelight. Sean Penn places a burned out, AndyWarhol-like rocker who lives in Dublin with hisfirefighter wife (Frances McDorman). He rushesback to the US, too late to say goodbye to hisdying father and then heads out on a road tripto track down an aging Nazi war criminalhiding in America and thus fulfill his dad'sdying wish. Yes, it's as nutty as it sounds.Director Paolo Sorrentino follows in thefootsteps of many Europeans who make moviesset in America. it feels like someone fromanother planet discovering a place that issomewhat similar to but oddly different from
the place you know. Penn walks a tightrope
with his truly off kilter hero, a sweetly daffy
soul who is far more perceptive than most people assume. If anyone had paid attention tothe film, he surely would have won an Oscar nomination. Fans won't want to miss it.Others will wonder what the heck they're watching.
LIFE  OF  PI  ($39.99 BluRay combo; FOX) -- I
didn't finish the novel Life  Of  Pi  (and I rarely</p>
<p>stop reading anything) so if you loved the book,
you can ignore me starting...now. The featurefilm version by one of my favorite directors,Ang Lee, was praised for its 3-D and gorgeousfairy tale look. I thought this parable about ayoung man on a small boat with a Bengal tigerwas dripping in goopy, pretty colors, like an
episode of My  Little  Pony  come to life. The 3-D
was a complete waste of time, amounting to
pointless distraction in the bookend scenes(gee, that fridge really looks like it's a few feetbehind the actor) and lame moments in the
heart of the tale (like having the tiger's paw
come out towards the audience). Audiences --
more than critics -- however, really embraced
the novel and film and it's certainly a lovingly edition with some solid making-of extras.
The ability to watch it without 3-D is a decided bonus.
EASY  MONEY  ($24.99 DVD; Anchor Bay) --
This twisty Swedish noir was one of the
undiscovered gems of 2012. A college studentfalls in with a rich crowd and turns to crime tomaintain a facade of wealth and ease. Hebecomes entangled with a fugitive from thecops and the Mob enforcer who wants tocapture the rogue first. Smart and great fun, it'sbased on a trilogy of crime novels. I can onlyassume the English language remake is alreadyin the works. Watch this so you can see the newversion and say confidently, "The original wasbetter."
THE
INTOUCHABLES  ($35.99 BluRay; Sony Pictures Classics) -- One of the truly hateful
films of the year, The Intouchables was an improbable worldwide smash hit that trafficsin the most offensive racial stereotypes imaginable. The fact that the film has an earnestheart and thinks it is making a plea for racial understanding makes it all the morenoxious. A paralyzed white man of wealth (Francois Cluzet) hires a poor, uneducated ex-con (Omar Sy) because he's the only one that doesn't treat Cluzet with pity. The white
people are uptight and listen to classical music and go to the opera. The black guy is a</p>
<p>funky life force who gets them to boogie down to soul music. The white guy exposes the
black guy to the world of the mind. The black guy of course is closer to the life force andactually enjoys life. Ugh. Cluzet and Sy, unfortunately, are very talented actors and makethis dreck seem almost acceptable. It's not.
SINISTER  ($39.99 BluRay combo; Summit) -- Trust Ethan
Hawke. When he does a B movie horror flick, you can bet hesusses one out with a decent script and an emphasis onatmosphere and creepiness rather than the slasher porn thatdominates these days. Fans of the genre repeatedly singled it outto me as a cut well above the low-brow horror flicks that seem tocome out almost every week during the slow months.
HITCHCOCK  ($39.99 BluRay combo; FOX) --
Watching a genius at work would make for a
fascinating film. Unfortunately, Hitchcock is
more interested in pop psychology and the off
camera life of Alfred Hitchcock (Anthony
Hopkins) and his wife (Helen Mirren) ratherthan an exploration of the making of Psycho .
The master would be mortified. Luckily, youcan ignore this (and the misguided Bates
Motel ) and actually watch Psycho  and Rear
Window  and Vertigo  and North  By  Northwest
and The  Lady  Vanishes  and The  39  Steps  and
Shadow  Of  A  Doubt  and Rebecca  and don't you
dare watch this unless you've already seen them
all. Twice.
WRECK-IT  RALPH  ($49.99 BluRay combo; Disney)
RISE  OF  THE  GUARDIANS  ($54.99 BluRay combo; DreamWorks Animation) -- Two
animated films that fall short, proving again how good Pixar was at its best. (And yes, Iput that in the past tense. I'm getting worried about them.) Despite its video game setting,Wreck-It  Ralph  is a by-the-numbers tale of a character who gets lost and then returns
home again. It's main virtues are some fine vocal work by Sarah Silverman and JaneLynch but the story is too routine to hold your interest. At least it feels like a workreaching for originality. Guardians , on the other hand, is too desperate to launch a
franchise to worry about things like characters and story and emotion. It wanted to launch</p>
<p>an Avengers -like team including holiday stars like Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the
Tooth Fairy and so on. No dice. The best extra comes on Ralph , which includes the Oscar-
winning short Paperman . As long as works of originality are being done in the shorts, we
can hope for another great animated film sometime soon.
THIS  IS  40  ($34.99 BluRay combo;
Universal) -- This spin-off from Knocked-Up
was uncalled for and unasked for, though it's
still fitfully fun to see Paul Rudd and Leslie
Mann as a married couple that can tear into
each other with glee. Still, the slapped-together
nature of the project is belied by the absurd 134
minute running time. I like everyone involved
but they're trying my patience. The few genuine
pleasures come courtesy of Albert Brooks. Isn't
it about time he give another project of his
own?
KILLING  THEM  SOFTLY  ($39.99 BluRay
combo; Anchor Bay/Weinstein)
RED  DAWN  ($39.99 Bluray combo; FOX) --
Two disappointments of very different sorts.
After The  Hobbit , the movie that let me down
the most was Andrew Domink's Killing  ThemSoftly . it's based on a terrific crime novel that is
bursting with hilarious, can't miss dialogue andvivid characters. But somehow the film doesmiss from beginning to end, starting with themodest but unnecessary change in time and theaddition of a mild political overlay that isdistracting. Even still, virtually nothing hereholds the attention despite a cast and crew thaton paper is faultless. Dominik's Chopper was agreat debut that launched Eric Bana.   The
Assassination  Of  Jesse  James  By  The  Coward
Robert  Ford  gave Brad Pitt one of his best parts and Casey Affleck the role of a lifetime.
It's one of the best films of the past decade. So I'm sure Dominik will deliver again. I justhope we don't have to wait five years. Red  Dawn  on the other hand was an unnecessary
remake of a fun little B movie I always liked defending. But this revisit failed to deepenthe characters or explore the moral complexity of a rebellion when your country is beingoccupied, the sort of layering that a remake and times demand. Instead it was just witlessfun that has me rethinking my appreciation of the original. I'm almost afraid to go back</p>
<p>and watch it again.
THIS  IS  NOT  A  FILM  ($19.99 DVD; Palisades Tartan) --
Finally, here is a thoroughly original work. Part protest, part
documentary, part essay, Iranian director Jafar Panahi hasresponded to a ban on making films by starring in a work that "isnot a film." Don't believe him. He shows the next film he wantedto make and discusses camera angles and the such by placingtape on the floor of his home and spelling it all out. This iscaptured on a cell phone and edited into the work we have here.Silencing people has never been more technologically impossiblethan it is today as this unique film amply demonstrates. I hate it
when people call actors or filmmakers "brave" for playing a role. No, cops and soldiersand firemen who risk their lives are brave. Playing a part on stage or film is not brave.Here's the exception to the rule.
