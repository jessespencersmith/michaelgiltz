From the Publisher: A remarkable young woman blazes her own trail,
from the backwoods of Russia to the court of Moscow, in theexhilarating sequel to Katherine Arden’s bestselling debut novel,  The
Bear and the Nightingale . Katherine Arden’s enchanting first novel
introduced readers to an irresistible heroine. Vasilisa has grown up at theedge of a Russian wilderness, where snowdrifts reach the eaves of herfamily’s wooden house and there is truth in the fairy tales told around thefire. Vasilisa’s gift for seeing what others do not won her the attention of
Morozko—Frost, the winter demon from the stories—and together they
saved her people from destruction. But Frost’s aid comes at a cost, andher people have condemned her as a witch. Now Vasilisa faces animpossible choice. Driven from her home by frightened villagers, the onlyoptions left for her are marriage or the convent. She cannot bring herself
to accept either fate and instead chooses adventure, dressing herself as a
boy and setting off astride her magnificent stallion Solovey. But afterVasilisa prevails in a skirmish with bandits, everything changes. The GrandPrince of Moscow anoints her a hero for her exploits, and she is reunited
with her beloved sister and brother, who are now part of the Grand
Prince’s inner circle. She dares not reveal to the court that she is a girl,for if her deception were discovered it would have terrible consequencesfor herself and her family. Before she can untangle herself from Moscow’sintrigues—and as Frost provides counsel that may or may not be
trustworthy—she will also confront an even graver threat lying in wait for
all of Moscow itself. Praise for The Girl in the Tower  “[A] magical story
set in an alluring Russia.” —Paste  “Arden’s lush, lyrical writing cultivates
an intoxicating, visceral atmosphere, and her marvelous sense of pacing
carries the novel along at a propulsive clip. A masterfully told story of
folklore, history, and magic with a spellbinding heroine at the heart of itall.”—Booklist (starred review) “[A] sensual, beautifully written, and
emotionally stirring fantasy . . . Fairy tales don’t get better thanthis.” —Publishers Weekly  (starred review) “[Katherine] Arden once again
delivers an engaging fantasy that mixes Russian folklore and history withdelightful worldbuilding and lively characters.” —Library Journal

What We Say
Katherine Arden's debut fantasy "The Bear and the Nightingale" was one of my favorite books of 2016. Set in medieval Russia
on the edge of the wilderness, it was filled with drama and danger as a young woman forged her own path, embraced the
old ways of honoring the spirits and sprites around her while a priest railed against witchcraft. Vasilisa ultimately risked all
-- down to grappling with the mysteriously compelling attentions of an ice demon -- but the book felt small and self-contained. Sure, the fate of the world hung in the balance, but Vasilisa's struggles felt internal and real, not melodramaticand world-shaking. The novel ended devastatingly and with a satisfying finish. I was eager to see what Arden would do next
and slightly surprised to discover it was a sequel. Sure, I was ready to follow Vasya anywhere and yes, the first novel was
open-ended as most good novels are (life goes on). But it wasn't one of those tiresome cliffhangers so many fantasies resortto -- one long story broken up into three parts. "The Bear and the Nightingale" can be read quite happily on its own. Notthe sequel. You'll simply have to read the first story to appreciate what's going on here. It begins at a gallop and neverpauses for a moment. Vasya has banished herself from the shattered family she protected and the village that now brands
her a witch. She's become a traveler or at least fancies herself one. The ice demon appears again and again, protecting
and cajoling and training Vasya for the dangers she will insist on facing. When posing as a boy, Vasya is delighted by thenew possibilities open to her. Instead of finding her sister in Moscow so she can be locked up in a tower and awaitmarriage, Vasya is free to roam the countryside thanks to the astonishing horse Solovey, with whom she handily
communicates. But life on the road is not easy. Villages are being preyed upon by warriors that seem to come and go
without a trace. Moscow is awash in intrigue and Vasya's mere presence there means tremendous risk for her warrior-monkof a brother and high-born sister. But the Grand Prince of Moscow decides this fierce but slight lad is his new favoritecompanion. So Vasya must hide in plain sight to protect her siblings and the Prince from the evil on all sides. This secondbook in the Winternight Trilogy feels much bigger than the first one, bursting with action and demons and the fate of a
nation on slim Vasya's shoulders. And she's a willful treat. Even if she seems rather dim about the fact that the ice demon
loves her, Vasya's unbridled joy in being able to go where she will and do what she wants will appeal to anyone. Unlike thefirst book, we are on a knife's edge by the end of this second, satisfying part. The finale can't come soon enough. -- MichaelGiltz
