8/08/2005 03:15:00 PM...in July of 2000. "This Week" on Sunday showed clips from anappearance by John Roberts on a local news show discussingthe just-ended term of the Supreme Court. Here's thetranscript from the Washington Post.Roberts certainly walked and talked like a far right conservativeabout the Boy Scouts, school prayer, abortion, etc. He said theterm made clear that we DIDN'T have a conservative SCOTUS,despite the fact that 7 of the 9 justices were put in byRepublicans. But he also used the phrase "the basic right to anabortion," though doubtless the far right won't get too upsetand the far left won't take too much comfort from that.Stephanopoulus and others dissect his comments thoroughly.My main observation: Roberts is going to make a very calm,cool nominee.
