THEATER: 'BLKS' IS SERIOUSLY FUNNY
BLKS  ** 1/2 out of ****
THE  ROBERT  W.  WILSON  MCC  THEATER  SPACE
To the growing list of playwrights of color pushing the boundaries of
contemporary theater, you can happily add the name of Aziza Barnes.
Is it any wonder they attracted the attention of red-hot director RobertO'Hara? No, it is not. He gives  BLKS  a solid showcase that also shows
off the versatility of the mainstage at the relatively new Robert W.
Wilson MCC Theater Space. This was my first visit to the latest
addition in NYC's collection of artistic spaces but it won't be my last.And this was my first chance to see a work by Barnes, but it surelywon't be my last for that either.
In this broad but pointed comedy, Octavia is having a bad day. She
(Paige Gilbert) freaks out over a mole on her clitoris. It wasn't thereyesterday! When her lover/friend with benefits/whatever Ry (CoralPeña) demurs when asked to play amateur gynecologist, Octavia has
had enough. She ends their brief fling/burgeoning romance (I don't
know what to call it because neither does Octavia). When roommateJune (Antoinette Crowe-Legacy) barges in and reveals her boyfriendhas cheated on her (again) and a relative of Octavia says thepotentially cancerous mole needs to be dealt with right away, they andfellow roomie Imani (Alfie Fuller) agree there's only one solution. Day
drinking, rolling a blunt and generally partying, of course.
What follows is a roundelay of sexual entanglements, hilarious banter
and the unwelcome but inevitable downer of reality intruding in onthe fun via a violent confrontation on the streets and social media
updates on the latest killing of a young black man.
Unlike other recent plays,  BLKS  is not extravagantly out there or form-
breaking. It's not a series of sketches, just a well-constructed play with
characters bouncing off one another in unexpected, revealing ways and
with a joyous sense of sisterhood. Even when they are practicallyMICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>swapping potential partners, you never doubt Octavia, June and Imani
have each others backs. And while the humor is broad and cranked up,
unlike Barnes we never doubt its essential seriousness either.
O'Hara oversees the show with affection but several elements hold itback. The scenic design by Clint Ramos is a trickster in its own right.The stage is wide and deep but the central space of the shared living
room in their apartment is presented at a cramped, odd angle. It's
puzzling until the set rotates again and again, almost going widescreenas Ramos reveals a bathroom, bedrooms, a club and even a city streetwith subway entrances. And yet it felt over-elaborate and attention-grabbing to me. You shouldn't be thinking about the sets as much as
we do here.
Worse, two roles are poorly cast. Marié Botha as That Bitch On The
Couch is merely ok as a clueless white woman bedeviled by what's
appropriate for her to say. And Octavia's love interest Ry was
mishandled entirely by Peña, making her Off Broadway debut andproving very uncomfortable onstage. Her body movement, her linedeliveries, literally everything about her proved awkward, never moreso than a key monologue at the climax she barely delivered, much less
brought to life.
The three leads are much better. Fuller reveals depths to Imani.
Crowe-Legacy is full-on Amazonian as she straddles the stage with herpersonality and take-command voice. And Gilbert anchors it all with
ease as the conflicted but decent Octavia. Playing a string of male
characters but mostly the nerdy, off-beat Justin (a guy who befriendsJune in a club), Chris Myers is scene-stealing good from start to finish.For a play centered on women, Barnes gifts him with a terrificshowcase and Myers makes the most of it.
I wish Barnes had trusted their own talents as much. News alerts
about the gunning down of young black men by the police both earlyon and at the end feel like an unnecessary attempt to prove the playhas serious intent. I never doubted it, thanks to the more organic►  June (3)

<p>inclusion of a burst of violence on the street and the wickedly funny
taunting Imani gives to a white woman she flirts with. Yet even at the
end, Barnes insists on a string of monologues that come from a
different world than the colorful comedy they created and make us
care about.
Indeed, Barnes has a gift for character and dialogue. After delivering
three women in a setting I'd be glad to return to, TV might just be in
their future.
NOTE: It's not every day NYC gets a new theater space. Check out this
