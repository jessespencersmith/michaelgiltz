<p>NON-FICTION  
Allah Is Merciful, Christian Scholar Says
Comparing God in the Bible, the Tanach and the Qur’an
 November 20, 2018  Michael Giltz
Scholar Jack Miles had a stroke of genius with his Pulitzer Prize winner God: A Biography . Putting aside
religious belief, he took a literary approach and looked closely at the character of G-d as presented in the
Tanach, that is, the Hebrew Bible. What is G-d like as a character? How does He (or she) change from story tostory? Does he grow and evolve like characters often do? Do we understand Him better and more completely atthe end or is He merely a static cardboard cutout? Does it even make sense to do this?
Miles combined erudite scholarship on religious texts with insight into the varied meaning of certain words. He
also included apocryphal texts, debates over the centuries by scholars and artists and religious leaders and muchmore. The result was eye-opening and illuminating, a work embraced by people of faith and no faith alike. ThenMiles did it again with Christ: A Crisis In The Life Of God , that time focusing in on the “character” of Jesus as
seen in the Gospels.
With his latest book, accomplishes what he thought he would never do: approach Allah– the God of the Qur’an –
in the same fashion as a literary character.   In fact, Miles synthesizes all his earlier work here for the stories of</p>
<p>← Stradivarius Going Up To Cali →Adam and Eve and Noah and Abraham and Moses and so on appear in the texts of all three faiths. Seeing the
subtle and sometimes significant ways in which the character of God differs proves genuinely fascinating andengaging, whatever your faith or lack thereof.
Spoiler alert! To be bluntly reductive, all three faiths have bloody passages that should give anyone pause. But
all three faiths fundamentally offer messages of peace and love. Yet there are real differences too. The God ofthe Jewish and Christian faith is mercurial, dangerous and willing to bargain. The Jewish G-d is focused on thehere and now, working to see the descendants of Abraham populate the world. The Christian God is focused onthe next life, a reward for those who believe. The Allah of the Qur’an? Again and again, Miles reveals a Godwho is consistently merciful and more forgiving, always looking for any chance to bring a wayward child backinto the fold. Of the three, this is the parent you’d go to first if you did something wrong.
Miles is patient and by and large focused on the text in front of him. But he’s not afraid to range widely too,
beginning his work with a quote from Rumi and tossing in references to everything from apocryphal texts toShakespeare and Milton if he thinks it can breathe life into his analysis. It’s a deeply respectful, engaging andrewarding book that could offend only the most fundamentalist of believers. Even then, they’d take offense onlyif they didn’t bother to read it and merely objected to the very idea. Christian, Jew, Muslim and atheist alikewould do well to embrace the open-minded curiosity on display.
