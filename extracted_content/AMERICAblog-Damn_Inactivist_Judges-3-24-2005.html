3/24/2005 11:15:00 PMThe Supreme Court has yet again followed the law and refusedto intervene in the Terri Schiavo case. The far-right can thankReagan-appointee Justice Kennedy for that."The judges are running this country," Ms. Schiavo's father saidoutside the hospice Thursday afternoon, according to the NewYork Times. "All the judges have banded together to supportJudge Greer."HIs comments are rather mild compared to what so manyothers are saying. Actually, the judges aren't getting involvedenough, are they? First they intervene, too much and now thedamn (in)activist judges aren't intervening enough? I wishthey'd make up their minds instead of following the rule of lawand interpreting the facts in front of them as they fit eachparticular case.And Gov. Bush! The far right is now threatening him with hellto pay if he "fails" to save Terri. Bush has literally exploredevery legal means of action, but Pat Robertson was on CNN thisevening saying a "piddling little judge" shouldn't be bossingaround the Governor of Florida. They are virtually demandingJeb Bush ignore the law and basically stage a coup by sendingin the National Guard and abducting Terri.With 80% (and more) of the country strongly believing thatCongress, the President and the Governor of Florida have goneway too far and overstepped their bounds, with people whocelebrate a culture of life also threatening the lives of judgesand Terri's husband, with Senator Frist offering a medicalprognosis via years-old videotape, with evangelicals demandingGov. Bush IGNORE the Constitution and simply use soldiers toforce his will, isn't it about time people started talking aboutthe republicans and the far right being drunk with power andout of control and -- seriously -- a danger to democracy. Howlong can they continue to attack our form of government andthe three branches formed under the wisdom of the FoundingFathers, how long can they mock and belittle and undermine anindependent judiciary until we start to call them what they are:un-American?
