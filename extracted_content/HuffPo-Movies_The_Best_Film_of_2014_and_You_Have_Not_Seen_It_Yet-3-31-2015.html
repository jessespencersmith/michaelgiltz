The Oscars said Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue Of Ignorance). The NewYork Film Critics said it was Boyhood. The LA Film Critics Association agreed, naming The Grand BudapestHotel as the runner-up. But if the IRAs have anything to say about it, the movie that might well rise in stature andcome to be remembered as one of the defining films of the year is...Nightcrawler. That was the big winner at the40th annual IRA Awards handed out over the weekend. It swept most major awards, including Best Picture, BestDirector and Best Actor. Despite a lot of acclaim (and a juicy supporting performance from Renee Russo thatshould have snagged her an Oscar nomination), it was passed over at the Oscars and by most critics groups. Itgrossed less than $40 million worldwide (most of that in the US), so chances are you haven't seen it yet. Youshould.But wait! Who are the IRAs? The IRAs is a mysterious but august film society that has voted on the best films ofthe year since 1976. More international and indie focused than the Oscars, more mercurial than the LA FilmCritics and more loyal to their favorites than the Golden Globes, the IRAs met over the weekend, voting for thebest film of 2014 (along with all the usual other categories) and capping off a two-year debate by finalizing theirpicks for the best films of the 1960s. They have no more claim to pronounce the best films of the year thananyone else but they've been doing it for decades so, hey, it's tradition!Below are their votes -- including nominees and winners in major categories -- followed by its list of the Top 100Films of the 1960s. If you want to see films that will endure, you could do worse than watch all five of the BestPicture nominees. And are you a serious film buff? Well, tell me, how many of the movies on the 1960s list haveyou seen?And the IRA goes to....BEST PICTURE1. Nightcrawler -- 29 pts. (out of a possible 45 pts.) 2. Foxcatcher -- 21 pts. 3.
