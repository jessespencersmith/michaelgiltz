3/25/2005 02:17:00 PMSad news coming out of the Middle East. With the worldfocused on its ills like never before and many wanting tobelieve these dictatorial countries might actually start torespect the rights of their peoples, Arab leaders had a summitmeeting and proved yet again that they're not ready for primetime."With major Arab leaders either skipping the meeting orsnubbing the League altogether, the conference became aforum for personal squabbles. Apparently in a gesture ofdisdain, Colonel Qaddafi lit up a cigarette as the session began.The leaders competed to keep each other late in efforts atone-upmanship. Some refused to be photographed together,"reports the New York Times."That dismayed many Arab news organizations. Coverage ofthe meeting was well below that of previous years, editors saidWednesday. The satellite television channel Al Jazeeradismissed the meeting as "yet another summit" in promotionsfor its coverage, which was generally critical andunsympathetic."Mind you, we're still "pressuring" Pakistan, Saudi Arabia andour new buddies Libya to -- you know -- ease up on sellingnuclear material and know-how to every rogue nation andsupporting terrorists. The winds of change are blowing!
