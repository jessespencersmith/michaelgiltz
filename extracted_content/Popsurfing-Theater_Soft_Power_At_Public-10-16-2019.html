THEATER: "Soft Power" In Hard Times
SOFT  POWER  ** out of ****
THE  PUBLIC  THEATER
In 2015, playwright David Henry Hwang had a very bad November.
First, Hillary Clinton was the choice of most Americans, including
Hwang. But the antiquated and ill-conceived Electoral College systemmeant Donald Trump became President of the United States. If thatwasn't bad enough for a Tony-winning New York liberal, Hwang wasattacked on the street. He was stabbed in the neck, nearly dying from a
random hate crime. The assailant took no money and fled after Hwang
shouted out in clear, unaccented English "What the fuck?," whichapparently threw the bastard for a loop.
These twin assaults on democracy and decency led Hwang to question
everything. Is the American experiment reaching an end? Will healways be too Chinese for some Americans and too American for someChinese? Where does he belong? Where does anyone  belong? And
why do musicals starring Asians appear on Broadway only once every
decade or so? And why is it almost always a revival of 
The  King  and  I?
Like any real artist, Hwang turned his pain and probing into art.  Soft
Power  is an awkward, ugly duckling of a play that yearns to transform
into a swan of a musical. It's a mess but boy is his heart in the rightplace: on his sleeve.
Actually, I've just described the set-up of the show. In it, the character
DHH (a too-earnest Francis Jue) is meeting with a producer from
Shanghai named Xūe Xíng (Conrad Ricamora). Xūe company wants to
turn Shanghai into the Broadway of Asia (though it kind of already is),starting with a big, fat, American-style musical with a Chineseperspective. And they want DHH to write it!MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>The movie they want him to adapt into this show? A hugely popular
romantic comedy about a husband and wife who are both miserable,
explore the idea of dating others but end up staying together for thesake of their vows and their child. It's called 
Stick  With  Your  Mistake
and the very Chinese idea of sacrifice for the greater good (of the
marriage, the family, the community, the country) is precisely what
appeals to Xūe and turns off Hwang.
Nonetheless, they go to a performance of The  King  and  I,  dissect the
musical's very problematic attitude towards non-Westerners,
acknowledge its emotional power, grab a chance to meet Clinton at a
meet-and-greet...and then Hwang is stabbed in the neck.
Hwang slips into a fever dream while recovering from his attack (in
which he lost a third of his blood). Hwang's desire to flip  The  King  and
I on its head comes to life, with Xūe in the role of Anna coming to the
United States to civilize the barbarous Americans.  Soft  Power  turns
into a full-on musical through the looking glass, showing how China
might see the US, from its obsession with guns to its ethnic prejudices
to its absurd system of government where the people choose their
leader, rather than an elite group of professionals. In China, Xūetempts Hillary, she'd already be the leader since Clinton is so clearlyqualified and ready. Maybe democracy is over-rated.
None of this captures the loopy nature of the show. It lovingly spoofsand quotes everything from A  Chorus  Line  to The  Music  Man  and of
course The  King  and  I,  among many other shows. At one point, when
Hillary is trying to dumb down her message to appeal to the masses,she belts out a song at a McDonald's and rides rodeo on a giant frenchfry. My  Fair  Lady 's "The Rain In Spain" is transformed into a number
where Xūe genially coaches Hillary on how to pronounce his name and
the meaning of fourth tone and so on.
The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court even goes all Schoolhouse
Rock  on us to explain our election system and the glory of the Ballot
Box. Remember, this is all from the perspective of a Chinese-fundedBOOKS: Don't Bother Trying To

<p>and mounted show that becomes Asia's seminal idea of what America
is really like, just as The  King  and  I  symbolized Western attitudes
towards Asia. Indeed, there's even a bizarre detour for a 50th
anniversary celebration of the musical we're watching, complete with
panel discussion and a silly Westerner they can gently mock. (Gently,because they're the one with all the power and America has long sincefaded from preeminence.)
You might imagine Hwang delivering a scathing take-down of the US
or a sly skewering of China's imagined fears about America anddemocracy. But you'll get neither. Soft  Power  is indeed soft in every
way -- it's gentle, earnest, polite and really not out to offend much of
anyone. Are we meant to be amused by China's distorted idea of
America or perhaps laugh at ourselves when seeing the US throughthe eyes of outsiders? Neither happens. McDonald's as a symbol of USconsumerism? Well, sure. (And hey, they've got one in Beijing.) Anobsession with guns? Duh. If that's how China sees us, well, they'repretty spot on there too, aren't they? So what's the point?
It's a treat to see an almost all-Asian cast in a musical. But that's not
enough. Soft  Power  is too timid to do more. If this is the flip-side of
The  King  and  I,  why is Xūe talking to Hillary? She lost, Hwang!
Hillary is not the leader of the country. Xūe (or really, a Chinesewoman) should be civilizing Trump . I can't blame Hwang for not
wanting to grapple with Agent Orange, even in his imagination. But ifhe's going to update The  King  and  I,  that's what he needed to do.
Since they kept Clinton, why cast a white woman? Alyse Alann Louis
has a lot of fun in dual roles, especially when Hillary is chowing down
on ice cream and pizza while singing the blues and surely her casting isthere to clarify the gap between East and West. But since Broadway(and Hollywood) has such a long history of casting white people in
yellow face, surely it would have been more on point to include, say,
the sole Japanese actor in a sea of Chinese faces to play the whitewoman. (Or at least a woman of color.) This certainly isn't a criticismof Louis, one of the show's bright points.
The cast is game for this grab-bag of a goof, even though Saturday
Night  Live  tries to be more pointed on a weekly basis. (And South
Park  actually succeeds.) By far the show's best element is Conrad
Ricamora as Xūe. He's sexy, charming, magnetic and all on his ownrescues the evening.
Ricamora was terrific in David Byrne's Here  Lies  Love.  You can have
fun going through the Playbill and spotting how many cast members
appeared in that show. It's a testament to the top-notch talent here,but also a comment on how few roles written for Asian actors.
Ricamora's Broadway debut after that breakthrough? 
The  King  and  I.
It's enough to make you cry.
In his Broadway debut, Ricamora played Tuptim's lover and I felt he►  July (7)

<p>was not up to the task vocally on the duet "I Have Dreamed." Here, his
singing demands are quite different. Ricamora shines on the show's
one solid number "Happy Enough," a piece illuminating the Chineseidea of sacrificing for the greater good. He is terrific in the serious
drama, the romance and the song-and-dance, not to mention
smoothly delivering two different accents. Thank goodness his hit TVshow How  To  Get  Away  With  Murder  has just begun its sixth and
final season. Ricamora should be available for a lot more theater andfilm work soon.
But this is mostly a musical and I fear the melodies by Jeanine Tesori
are akin to her work on Caroline,  Or  Change  and Fun  Home.
Sometimes her score can be beautiful and the 22-piece orchestra
certainly does it justice. Yet she has no interest in melody and it shows.
I don't need Jerry Herman, but I need something  and Tesori offers it
up rarely and grudgingly. You'll find no equivalent to Fun  Home's"Ring Of Keys" here, though in its way "Happy Enough" comes close.
That song is also the show's best effort at exploring cultural differences
between the US and China. Stereotypically, the US champions theindividual, while Chinese culture celebrates the greater good. The songoffers a nuanced moment and is worthy of Hwang's best intentions --here, he's not spoofing or making a point, merely revealing. Otherwise,he can't bring himself to question much about the US any more than
he can acknowledge that Trump won and is the real King right now.
If this show were the mirror-image of that Rodgers & Hammerstein
show, it would end with the the King being "civilized" by the Chineseinterloper who offers a new way of ruling. Instead, Hillary firmly
rejects Xūe's idea of a one-party state or anything less than full
democracy. If there's anything much to learn from Chinese culture (asopposed to the current Chinese government, of course), Soft  Powerdoesn't grapple with it. No wonder director Leigh Silverman handlestraffic nicely but can't bring this muddle into focus.
Hwang's message, his big revelation is the same as that Chinese
romantic comedy: "stick with your mistake." In other words, you don'tgive up on the US just because Trump won an election. You stay and
fight for the greater good. Well, I don't know about Hwang, but I had
no intention of divorcing the US after the election. I never wanted totrash the American experiment. After 2016, I just wanted to trash theElectoral College.
