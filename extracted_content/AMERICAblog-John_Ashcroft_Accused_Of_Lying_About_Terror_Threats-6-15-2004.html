John Ashcroft Accused Of Lying About Terror
Threats
by Michael in New York  on 6/15/2004 10:37:00 AM
Op-ed columnist Paul Krugman eviscerates  Attorney General John
Ashcroft in today's New York Times. Krugman details repeated
examples of Ashcroft coming under fire for his terrible jobperformance and responding by attacking the messenger or makinggrandiose claims of foiling terrorist plots (ie. that "dirty bomb"maker) that prove to be false. As John Aravosis questioned hereyesterday, Krugman sarcastically implies that the foiled "plot" to
attack an Ohio mall is bogus or at the very least puffed up and
announced only when expedient. Think about how outrageous thattruly is. Why aren't there Congressional hearings into exploring thepossibility that the Attorney General of the United States isfabricating terrorist plots against the US in order to protect his
career?
