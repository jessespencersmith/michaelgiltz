8/12/2004 09:14:00 AMBush's political hardball wins again. He floats a nominee -- PorterGoss -- who in the past year has earned Bush's trust by engaging inpartisan attacks on Kerry, including distorting the Bushadministration's own intelligence on North Korea to score politicalpoints. Democrats and even some top Republicans expresswidespread concern that Goss is too partisan. Bush nominates himanyway and the Dems cave.What does this mean for our national security? Bush has chosen aCIA head who has belittled Kerry and would certainly have to bereplaced in January. How does this help the war on terror? The headof the CIA is rarely a politician and usually non-partisan. One bigcomplaint is how politicized the intelligence coming from them mighthave been. Goss was a major player in trying to block the 9/11commission even coming into existence and has defended the CIA'shidebound ways for years. Sound like the man to fix those problems,however decent he might be?Bush has purposefully chosen someone without broad bipartisansupport, which means the CIA -- which has been working with aninterim head -- will be raked over the coals and then get a head whomight very well become a lame duck and need to be replaced justweeks after getting the job. That means if Bush loses, there will be agood seven months with the CIA without a boss it knows is there forthe long haul. Is that making us safer? Is it too much to ask when theCIA needs a major overhaul and we're in a tight election race thatBush look to the future and choose someone in consultation with theDems that could get to work on the CIA's major problems TODAY?Instead of playing politics? Bush is the one weak on intelligence hereand the Dems are letting him get away with it.
