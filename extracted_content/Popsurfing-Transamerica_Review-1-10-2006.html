            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT U E S D AY,  J A N U A RY  1 0 ,  2 0 0 6"Transamerica" -- The Popsurfing ReviewJust checked out"Transamerica," which I'd avoided out of fear of its being too noble.Felicity Huffman of "Desperate Housewives" is indeed very good asBree, a man who is in the final stages of switching his gender and aboutto go under the knife. Somehow, Huffman's face looks puffier, thickerand you unquestionably believe her as a woman trapped in a man'sbody about to become a woman.The problem? The rest of the movie is melodramatic in the extreme.Isn't switching genders drama enough for one film? Unfortunately,Bree discovers she fathered a son and in the first 20 minutes of the filmwe discover he's in jail for holding drugs, an exceptionally good lookingstreet hustler, his mom is dead, he hates his step-dad and his dream isto go to LA and be in the movies (not such a crazy dream since he'sexceptionally good looking and by "movies" he means "porn").It goes down from there, though Huffman and Graham Greene in asmall role maintain their dignity. It's difficult to tell if Kevin Zegers --who plays her son -- is talented since he's saddled with so much absurddialogue. Still, he's certainly come a long way from "Air Bud" --Canadian Zegers is seen in skimpy underwear, skinny dipping, sleepingwith clients or nude a good five or six times throughout the film. Keptmy attention, as did the credits: Dolly Parton sang an original tune andit was certainly more entertaining than the last 100 minutes. ** -- twostars out of four.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
