 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyMovies: NYFF #2 -- Dreileben  This
Year's Red Riding Trilogy (Almost)
DREILEBEN TRILOGY  ** 1/2 out of ****
Part One: Beats Being Dead  ***
Part Two: Don't Follow Me Around  ***
Part Three: One Minute Of Darkness  **
NEW YORK FILM FESTIVAL
The New York Film Festival kicks into high gear on Day
Two with the German trilogy Dreileben . it contains three
films -- each about 90 minutes in length -- all linked in
some way to the story of an alleged killer on the loose.
You immediately think of the UK Red Riding  trilogy,
which looked into the corruption and decay of the
Yorkshire police. It was based on a quartet of books by
David Peace. These films are originals, each one directed by a different rising talent from Germany.
Another key difference is that the Red Riding  films were first and foremost crime stories, whereas in
Dreileben  the man on the loose is merely a haunting presence until the final film.
Part One is called "Beats Being Dead" and it's the best of the bunch. In it, a young man studying to be a
doctor is in the somewhat isolated region of Dreileben. He's a favorite of the top man but on the outswith the man's pretty daughter, who our hero had been dating. That leads him unexpectedly into the
arms of a young local woman, who is from a different class and indeed from a different world. She's
friends with a biker gang of sorts and their tense, uneasy but immediately sexual relationship has a nicesee-saw quality as each one gains the upper hand depending on where they are and what they're doing.Wandering the streets or anytime the gang is near, she's in charge. In his world of privilege, our hero
seems to have the upper hand. In a very brief time they flirt and have sex and she is soon fantasizing

<p>about going with him to Los Angeles when he begins the next phase of his training. Class, gender,
education, physical strength -- it all comes into play here in an interesting way, with the killer on the
loose a shadowy bogeyman. An abrupt, intriguing ending makes this the most satisfying film of the bunch
and it can easily be enjoyed on its own. Here's a scene from the film.
(Note: That's Linda Ronstadt singing on "Cry Me A River." She's blossomed into an excellent big band
singer; I hope she does more.)
Part Two is called "Don't Follow Me Around." It revolves around a female detective who is part of a team
that's come to town to help with the manhunt. However, it soon turns out the team is also there to crackdown on corruption, something the local cops are none too pleased about. Our heroine stays with an old
friend and the woman's best-selling author of a husband. Complicated entanglements ensue because both
women were once in love with another man and our heroine encourages (or just doesn't deter?) herfriend from leaving the husband to pursue that lost love. But for what reason? It's a little twisty and
unexpected and the ending is again satisfying. As with all three films, there is some modest cross-over of
characters.
Part Three is called "One Minute Of Darkness." It's easily the weakest because the focus is on the alleged
killer on the loose. He's not necessarily mentally challenged but he's rather simple to say the least, asheltered mamma's boy who may or may not have lashed out in violence without quite being fully
responsible for his actions. Or so we imagine after following him for a while. Even an evil man can be
empathized with as he's hunted down and this fellow seems so odd and harmless, you easily root for him(at least a little) as he clambers through the forest, hides in storm drains and the like. However, he's alsorather dull and the wrap-up is a cheat on several levels and very unsatisfying.
Overall, Dreileben  is an interesting stunt filled with some solid performances, though it might be
draining as a festival event and better enjoyed on DVD.Thanks for reading. Michael Giltz is the cohost of Showbiz Sandbox,  a weekly pop culture podcast that
