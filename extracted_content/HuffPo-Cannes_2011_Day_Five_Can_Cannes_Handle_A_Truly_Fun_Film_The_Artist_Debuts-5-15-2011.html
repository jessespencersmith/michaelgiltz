 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyCannes 2011 Day Five: Can Cannes
Handle A Truly Fun Film? "TheArtist" Debuts
Okay, one more day until Malick's The Tree Of Life.
Should this really be seen as the only hope for the fest?I've already seen several movies that were good to verygood and some fare from Sundance that proved worthyof their praise. The one thing no one expected was alight, frothy ode to classic Hollywood. Can Cannes evenhandle a comedy? The last one to win the Palme d'Orwas maybe the darkly black Coen Brothers movieBarton Fink  or before that Robert Altman's MASH  all
the way back in the 1970s. So let's just assume that thevery warm applause The Artist  received was due more to
relief after a string of grim movies and not a sign ofthings to come.
THE ARTIST  *** 1/2 out of ****
Not since Bob Clark made up for his Porky's  movies with A Christmas Story  have we seen a director
make such a leap. Director Michel Hazanavicius is best known in France for the 077  spy comedies (more
akin to Matt Helm than Austin Powers in style). Out of nowhere he's delivered an essentially silent filmcomplete with intertitles that is a delightful ode to classic Hollywood. Shot in black and white and hitting

<p>just the right tone throughout, The Artist  is great fun. The two leads are completely unknown to me, but
winning and dead-on when it comes to capturing the style of silent film acting and broad but appealing
manner of Hollywood flicks from the 20s and 30s. It's 1927 and Jean Dujardin is George Valentin, thebiggest star around. Berenice Bejo is Peppy, the ardent fan swept out of anonymity and into overnight
success. She can handle the wrenching change to sound movies but George is set adrift, pouring his heart
and soul into a directing effort that is the pinnacle of silent film success but hopelessly out of date as far
as audiences are concerned. The stock market crash doesn't help in the least. Her star rises, his falls and
she can't even help him out without hurting his feelings.
Again, this is essentially a silent film, not counting a clever nightmare sequence where sound overwhelms
George at every turn. The tone is playful but romantic as well and the two leads have chemistry andcharm to burn. They're surrounded by excellent support, including John Goodman as a softie of a studiotycoon and James Cromwell as a chauffeur first for George and then for Peppy. The score (which at onekey moment uses Bernard Herrmann) is marvelous and the scenes of Hollywood filmmaking almost asmuch fun as the scenes of stars being stars on and off the set. It sounded like a lame spin on Singin' InThe Rain.  It turns out to be a true delight that movie buffs should embrace. The only thing pedestrian
about the film is its title. Maybe like Clark's A Christmas Story,  this will remain Hazanavicius's only
notable legacy. Maybe he'll go on to deliver more original and worthwhile fare. But for one moment atleast, Hazanavicius has proven he's an artist.
TAKE SHELTER  *** out of ****
Shotgun Stories  was one of my favorite films of 2007. Take Shelter  may not make my final list in 2011
(though I certainly want to see it again), but it unquestionably proves that writer-director Jeff Nichols is
the real deal and that actor Michael Shannon is his De Niro. Take Shelter  is about a man who works in
construction and is happily married with a wife and a young daughter who is deaf. A quiet, stable man, he(Shannon) is suddenly plagued with horrifying nightmares in which his dog attacks him, people try and
grab his daughter or -- again and again -- a storm of terrifying proportions is coming. These panic attacks
get worse and worse but our hero won't confide in his wife. He's worried that this is a sign of mentalillness, the same thing that drove his mother into a home in her mid-30s and scarred his childhoodpermanently. He both reaches out to a therapist and risks his financial situation by expanding theirbackyard storm shelter, just in case. As the visions or nightmares get worse and worse, he becomes moreand more unhinged, desperate to find out whether he's losing his mind or getting a sign of theapocalypse. It's a bold tale that reminded me somewhat of the otherwise dissimilar movie The Rapture.It's quiet and understated, even as it shows a man unraveling or receiving the sort of prophetic signs thatused to be more commonplace in our preindustrial world. It's intelligent, engaging filmmaking andthough it's taken four years for Nichols to follow his excellent debut, I'm already eager to see his nextwork. Here's Nichols talking about his movie.

<p>MARTHA MARCY MAY MARELENE  *** out of ****
Here's another movie that came to Cannes with deserved good buzz from earlier festivals. Writer-
director Sean Durkin makes an impressively assured feature debut and Elizabeth Olsen (who physically
resembles Maggie Gyllenhaal but is of the Olsen acting family) is definitely a talent to watch. Together,
they tell the story of Martha, a young woman whose parents died young and went to live with her aunt
since an older sister (Sarah Paulson) was already in college. That has kept them apart emotionally andquite literally for the past two years when Martha dropped out of sight. A panicked, desperate phone callbrings Martha back into her sister's life, though she won't say where she's been or what she's been doingexcept for vague lies. Turns out Martha was in a cult, drawn in by the charismatic leader (John Hawkes ofDeadwood) who preyed on her vulnerability and lack of trust. In flashbacks we see him rename herMarcy May as the acceptance and support of Martha's new "family" makes her feel wanted and special forthe first time in her life, even as the leader takes her in a sexual act that's brutally unromantic and leads
her down a path towards Manson-like behavior. (The Marlene, by the way, is the name the women in the
cult must use when answering the telephone.)
Truth be told, the flashbacks to the cult are far more interesting than the present scenes of Martha's
awkward inability to relate to her sister or her sister's husband (Hugh Dancy, nicely prickly). But thesense of unease she feels -- greatly enhanced by a marvelously creepy and unusual score by Daniel Bensiand Saunder Juriaans -- keeps us on edge wondering if Martha will collapse mentally or just as likely betracked down by the cult that is only a few hours away. It's a mature, striking and ultimately hauntingmovie that allows you to understand how someone can get trapped into such a bizarre and unlikelyworld. All it takes is pain and vulnerability and the bad luck to run into someone who will take advantageof it.

<p>It's quite depressing when a movie makes sex dull or at least conventional. Perhaps that's inevitable
when making a movie in a brothel, where sex is just commerce. This film written and directed byBertrand Bonello is set almost entirely in a brothel at the turn of the 20th century. We get to superficiallyknow the women who work there, the madam who feels pressured by rising rents, the clients who havetheir favorite girls as well as their favorite perversions and so on. It's all quite unremarkable, despite adecent cast that does their best. Odd touches include the classic soul music that appears at brief jarringmoments, as echoed in this trailer which includes some brief topless women and therefore is not suitablefor work.
If the movie had anything remotely interesting to say about prostitution, it escaped me. Bonello might
have been saying "pity the poor prostitute" (the film ends with a flash forward to the present when we seethe same actresses playing streetwalkers) or it might just as easily have been comparing the camaraderiefound in a brothel compared to the shameful degradation of the streets and calling for a return tolegalized bordellos. I don't know or care what Bonello thinks, since he barely created any characters Icould care about or a story that did more than meander along. It's pointless and dull, much likeprostitution, and at the end of it no one handed me $50.
