8/15/2004 03:17:00 PMActually, Bush simply has no idea what he's talking about when itcomes to a national sales tax. Bush was in Florida last week and tolda hand-picked audience it was an interesting idea that they ought toexplore. Later, his own staff said that the President had no idea whathe was talking about -- okay, they just denied that Bush isconsidering such a tax, even though that's exactly what he said hewas doing. Nice twist? Kerry effectively slams Bush on it.
