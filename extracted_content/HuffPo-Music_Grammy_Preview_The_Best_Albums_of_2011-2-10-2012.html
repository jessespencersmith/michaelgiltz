 Inspiring Funny Hot Scary Outrageous Amazing Weird CrazyGrammy Preview: The Best Albums
of 2011 From Top to Bottom
I've traveled to the future and can reassure you that
Adele will have a fun night at the Grammys on Sunday.Her album is one of those inevitable triumphs at anawards show that feels right. Adele has dominated thecharts and the radio and critics; if she'd been able totour, we'd probably be saying how much better hersongs sound in concert than they do on the album andrealize she has room to grow. Her smash hit 21  is in
every sense the album of the year.
So I was surprised in my recent trip down South to realize how few people actually own it. Five millioncopies is nothing to sneeze at in the North American market, but a lot more people should snap it up. Ifand when they do, here are some other albums you might want to consider purchasing as well. Thesedays, you can check them out first on Spotify or MySpace so you won't have to take my word for it beforespending your precious entertainment dollars. I have an embarrassing lack of classical music this year (Ijust wasn't exposed to much), but there's something for almost everyone -- pop, rock, country, jazz,gospel, world music, film scores, ambient, folk and more. If you've liked the artist before or enjoy thegenre, I'll bet it's worth your time.
Now make sure you read the list and immediately chide me for not including so and so (Wilco! Jayhawks!
Tuneyards!) or for foolishly including so and so (Panic! at the Disco? Really?) or for having one act toohigh (Glen Campbell in the Top 10?) or too low (Frank Ocean at the bottom?). Hey, it wouldn't be fun if
we didn't argue. I'm especially looking forward to getting tips about any albums I haven't heard yet.
Chances are if an act is on a lot of year-end lists that I probably already gave it a listen. But little known
favorites of yours are very welcome comments indeed. That's certainly all I hope to achieve with my
picks: point you in the direction of an album or two I think you'll love. And now, the list! Come back over
the weekend and I promise to add in some comments explaining my choices.

BEST ALBUMS OF 2011 -- THE EXPANDED LIST
1. FLEET FOXES  Helplessness Blues  (CSN rocks out) I really struggled with which album to put on top
this year. Usually it's simply the album I played the most. But this year I was just crazy about all the
album in my Top 5 (and Adele at #10 certainly didn't need more promotion from me). Finally, it was the
pure sonic beauty of Fleet Foxes that sealed the deal. Every single time I put it on I got chills and thegorgeous vocals, stirring arrangements and wave of emotions they brought out in me. Are there albumsjust as good from 2011? Yes. But none were prettier.

http://t.co/aF6W2ZQh</p>
<p>2. KING CREOSOTE & JON HOPKINS  Diamond Mine  (quirky concept album, gorgeously done)
Very few in the U.S. paid attention to this odd little album; in the U.K. it appeared on more lists but not
with the fervor it deserves. it's a concept album about life in a fishing village, complete with mutteredvoices, people grabbing a bite in the local greasy spoon, various characters stepping forward to tell their
story and so on. But what a gorgeous, fragile thing of beauty this is. It's just a little over half an hour long
but the experience is so intense and enveloping, you'll feel like you've just sunk into another world and
wake up slowly and reluctantly. I'm playing it again and feel tempted to put it on top all over again.People have heard of Fleet Foxes but this will surely be new to virtually everyone reading it. If you likeRobert Wyatt (I don't know what else to compare this unique work to), jump. (Seriously, I've been writing
this list while Diamond Mine plays and it's breaking my heart with the vulnerability and empathy on
display. Great melodies. Simple but somehow perfect vocals with just the right sonic touches. A real
keeper.)
3. TOM WAITS  Bad As Me  (bohemian troubadour in top form) Just one song kept the great Waits from
the top. I've liked so much of what he's done over the years, including the industrial strength clamor of
much of his work in the past decade. Here his sonics are more restrained so fans who haven't visitedWaits in a long time should dive back in. This is one of his strongest works in years, from the typicallyclanging opener "Chicago" (it settles down soon enough) to the heart-breaking closer "New Year's Eve,"the sort of drunken elegy Waits does so well we take it for granted. So what song spoiled it ever soslightly? "Last Leaf On The Tree," a fine little ditty that simply repeats itself to distraction. At two
minutes this slight tune would go by quickly. At four minutes it's a bit of a distraction given the limited
melody on display. Keep this in perspective: I was niggled by a few bars of one song on an otherwisemarvelous work that shows Waits as deeply in command as ever. Like Neil Young and Bob Dylan andother greats, time is not dimming his talent in the least.</p>
<p>4. GILLIAN WELCH  The Harrow and the Harvest  (simple, straightforward, striking folk) Well, if
Welch is gonna make us wait years and years for a new album, at least she delivers the goods and then
some. This follow-up to Soul Journey  is impeccable folk-rock. It could just as easily have been my Album
of the Year.
5. TEDDY THOMPSON  Bella  / kd lang  Sing It Loud  /RON SEXSMITH  -- Long Player, Late
Bloomer  (pure pop by pure pros) No, I'm not consistent. Sometimes I get annoyed when the music press
genuflects in front of the latest offering from the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, et al in almost an
unconscious reflex. On the other hand, when they ignore terrific new music by established acts that aren'tat the superstar level, I want them to pay attention. Maybe these artists simply don't have heat. TeddyThompson hasn't broken through commercially despite getting better and better with every album, somaybe the press has written him off as an act that can't sell magazines. kd lang hasn't come out in awhile, so what new can you say about her? And we all know Sexsmith is an impeccable pop craftsman;didn't Elvis Costello tell us so for years? Nonetheless, all three have delivered absolutely top-notch pop
albums. If you've ever been a fan, don't hesitate for a moment.</p>
<p>6. WYNTON MARSALIS AND ERIC CLAPTON  Play the Blues  / BRANFORD MARSALIS AND
JOEY CALDARAZZO  Songs of Mirth And Melancholy  (trad jazz) Surely the Marsalis brothers hate
having all their work linked. Oh well. Wynton has found new purpose and a sense of joy via collaborations
with the likes of Willie Nelson and now Clapton. Their jam session brings out the best in both of them.(Who knew "Layla" would prove so malleable?) And does anyone in jazz have a more gorgeous tone thatBranford? For sheer sonic beauty, it's the best since Getz. HIs album is also a collaboration and it leansmore heavily on melancholy than mirth. Great stuff.</p>
<p>7. GLEN CAMPBELL  Ghost on the Canvas  (haunting country pop) I have no strong affection for Glen
Campbell and won't try and retroactively make his career more important than it deserves. I think a
strong greatest hits album sums him up very well, which is hardly something to sneer at. Many artistsnever get even that. So his illness and late period Cash-like recording don't tug at my heartstrings for anyreason other than the music. But what music. Campbell's voice -- his greatest weapon -- isn't remotely asgood as in his heyday but now we can appreciate what a terrific singer he always was. Like Elvis Presley'salbum Elvis Country (I'm 10,000 Years Old) , this combines terrific songs with spoken word passages to
spooky, marvelous effect.
8. BOMBINO  Agadez (Tuareg rocks!) / BOUBACAR TRAORE  Mali Denhou  (gentle African guitar) /
LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO  Songs From a Zulu Farm  (ecstatic and playful children's music)
Bombino is a guitarist par excellence, a superstar in Africa who draws on traditional sounds along with
rock and blues while delivering the seemingly endless pleas for peace and hope that Africa invariablyneeds but lacks. He surely acknowledges a debt to Traore, a fellow African who suffered not from</p>
<p>repression but by seeming linked to oppressors and being out of favor for years because of it. Happily,
they can find common ground in their music. Then there's Ladysmith Black Mambazo, an act you knowand -- if you've seen them in concert -- love. This album of children's songs they learned as kids growingup in rural South Africa is one of their lightest and most sheerly entertaining in their entire discography.
9. VARIOUS ARTISTS  This May Be My Last Time Singing: Raw African American Gospel on 45 RPM
(1957-1982)  (lo-fi, high flying gospel that's so good you'll convert) This followup to the excellent
compilation Fire in My Bones  is another revelation. Filled with well-known tunes and obscure songs
performed generally by acts only the most devoted gospel listener has heard of (no Kirk Franklin or
Mahalia here), it's a delight from beginning to end. The so-so sound quality of many of these raritiesactually works to the album's benefit. You feel like you're listening to them via a transistor radio catchinga far-away station or maybe down the block from a house of worship. The performances are joyous,foreboding, ecstatic and majestic.</p>
<p>10. ADELE  21 (unstoppable soul diva) A great album with a string of singles that get better and better
the more you hear them -- that's about as great as pop music gets. Beyonce and Lady Gaga had some
great singles, but they couldn't come within a mile of the genuine artistic statement of this album. Here's
hoping Adele stays healthy vocally and unhealthy in her choice of men. Yep, it's Mary J. Blige all overagain -- do we really want to risk Adele writing about how content she is? Don't worry; we'll be there tocomfort you.
11. GROUPLOVE  Never Trust a Happy Song  (raucous L.A. pop-rock) Why this L.A. band isn't the toast
of the town simply escapes me. Terrific stuff.
12. PANIC! AT THE DISCO  Vices & Virtues  (sterling but overlooked pop-rock) Am I a sucker for pure
pop? Panic! can add or drop the exclamation point as many times as they want as long as they keep</p>
<p>creating indelible melodies and stirring rock like they do here.
13. NICK LOWE  The Old Magic  (vintage wine, vintage bottle) I've never been deeply invested in Nick
Lowe but boy is this a charmer. The only reason it isn't higher on my list is because I haven't listened to it
enough yet. This video isn't from his current album. But it's recent and shows Lowe in excellent form.
14. WILD FLAG  Wild Flag  (giving super groups a good name) Sleater-Kinney lives in this new band
composed of some of the talent from that group and their friends. Unruly fun.</p>
<p>15. BRAD MEHLDAU  Modern Music  (dependably adventurous jazz trio)/ COLIN VALLON  -- Rruger
(bold EU trio following in Mehldau's wake) Mehldau is consistently great so the strength of his latest is
no surprise. Now his influence is seeping out to the continent, not by the obvious tactic of covering
unexpected pop songs but simply in their commitment to the piano-led jazz trio.
16. JAY-Z AND KANYE WEST  Watch the Throne  (braggadocio taken to new heights) Neither is quite
my cup of tea but they've delivered great works before. West's last album was the first one I truly loved.
Together they indulge in the usual hip-hop obnoxiousness of boasting and putting down bitches, but
somehow they're in such good spirits here it kind of won me over.</p>
<p>17. BON IVER  Bon Iver  (stares down success with quiet confidence) Bon Iver's intense publicity
surrounding his last album didn't corner him into repeating himself. This album gently expands his sonic
palette. I thought maybe he was the flavor of the week, but who knows? He might just be in it for the
long haul.
18. BALLAKE SISSOKO AND VINCENT SEGAL  Chamber Music  (delicate instrumentals) I could
look up all sorts of facts about who they are, where they come from, their instruments and the like. But
the simple fact is that their album is lovely.
19. PAUL SIMON  So Beautiful or So What (mortality, musically) I can't remember the last time I put a
Paul Simon album on my best of the year last. (Probably Rhythm of the Saints. ) And I love the guy! As
one of the all-time greats, I hold him to a higher standard. And he meets it here on this pop gem about</p>
<p>facing death with wit, resignation and some excellent melodies.
20. BETH HART & JOE BONAMASSA  Don't Explain  (the blues, thumpingly good) The blues make
for a stomping good time when performed with such glee.
21. PRESERVATION HALL JAZZ BAND AND DEL MCCOURY BAND  American Legacies  (an
institution finds new life via collaboration) PHJB is an institution and as such, much of its best work was
probably behind it. Until 2010 when it collaborated with an all-star cast to celebrate some anniversary oranother and the band produced one of its most enjoyable albums in years. One of those collaboratorsproved so successful, they went and recorded an entire album. The results do not disappoint.</p>
<p>22. AMBROSE AKINMUSIRE  When the Heart Emerges Glistening  (quietly probing jazz) A sterling
Blue Note debut by one of jazz's best young trumpeters. A clutch of strong originals, a great young
quintet, focus,vision -- this is very exciting indeed. For a live performance from his new album, you must
go to YouTube .
23. JAMES BLAKE  James Blake  (trippy pop) Not my thing usually, but Blake has enough snippets of
emotion to keep me returning and every time I do it seems a little more cohesive and satisfying.
24. VARIOUS ARTISTS  Live From the Old Town School  (folk's beating heart) Sometimes you go out to
track down history. Other times you can wait quietly and have it come to you. The Chicago center of folk
Old Town School has seen countless legends pass through its doors. Apparently they knew it andrecorded everyone who came to town. This 4 CD set contains a truckload of inspired performances fromTaj Mahal and Mahalia Jackson to Jeff Tweedy and Peter Case. A fourth CD devoted to world musicdoesn't have quite the same impact but the overall level of quality and the mix of great and unexpectedmake this a genuine discovery. Here's a performance (not from the album) by Steve Dawson at thelegendary venue.</p>
<p>25. GIRLS  Father, Son, Holy Ghost  (interesting identity crisis) I loved the first album by Girls but was
slightly suspicious nonetheless. Now their proper followup has me even more nervous. Each song seems
to come from an entirely different band. Do Girls even know what sort of sound they're going for, if any?It shouldn't work but the album holds together for me out of sheer perversity. You have no idea what toexpect but it's all good. I hope they find more direction next time but for the moment the grab-bagapproach is working just fine.
26. TINARIWEN  Tassili  (bluesy, distinctive, campfire sing-alongs) One of the strongest acts in world
music for the past few years, Tinariwen don't disappoint with their latest. I always picture them
performing around a campfire in the middle of the desert, the flames the only light for miles around? AmI romanticizing or fetishizing them? Maybe. But their music is bluesy and distinctive enough to travelaround the globe so I'm sure it'll withstand my flight of fancy.</p>
<p>27. JOY FORMIDABLE  The Big Roar  (noisy pop) A child of Nirvana, they have its gift for making an
unholy racket but keeping it reined in with a very strong pop sense. Very good stuff.
28. DARI0 MARINELLI WITH JACK LIEBECK  Jane Eyre soundtrack  (the year's best traditional
score)/ MATTHEW COOPER  Some Days Are Better Than Others  (the year's best untraditional score)
The score for the fine remake of Jane Eyre is the best orchestral score of the year. I haven't even seen the
indie film Some Days Are Better Than Others , but the pop instrumental score by Matthew Cooper is so
stirring and lovely it certainly makes me want to right away.</p>
<p>29. THE CORAL  Butterfly House /THE MAGIC NUMBERS  Runaway  (pop, unimported,
unrecognized) I kept waiting for both of these albums to be released in the U.S. but they never were.
Both bands are more appreciated in the U.K. than they are here. The Coral live for nuggets-style garage
rock while Magic Numbers savor the gorgeous vocals of Laurel Canyon. Multiple tracks should be bigradio hits.
30. PISTOL ANNIES  Pistol Annies  / MIRANDA LAMBERT  Four The Record  (country's top gal and
friends) Miranda Lambert -- the SECOND runner-up on the late, lamented (by me) talent show Nashville
Star, just keeps growing. Her latest solo album isn't quite as good as her last. But it's good. And then sheturns around and forms Pistol Annies with some friends to fill the gaping hole where the Dixie Chicks</p>
<p>used to be. Combine her best work on both of these album and you've got a great work indeed.
31. THE LOW ANTHEM  Smart Flesh  (brainy Americana) Still waiting to break through to a wider
audience a la Avett Brothers and Mumford & Sons. That good.
32. CHARLIE HADEN AND QUARTET WEST  Sophisticated Ladies  (female singers, jazz swingers) A
great lover of classic jazz singers pairs with some of today's best vocalists and hits some standards out of
the park. Melody Gardot, Cassandra Wilson and Diana Krall are along for the ride.</p>
<p>33. THE BLACK KEYS  El Camino  (rock, no fuss) I respected and admired and appreciated The Black
Keys but never quite dug them until last week when I was walking down Fifth Avenue (one of the least
Black Keys-appropriate streets in NYC) when it just clicked and I could groove on their music.Sometimes it just takes the right frame of (an open) mind.
34. M83  Hurry Up, We're Dreaming  (ambient pop) Another act where I need the right setting. In their
case, it usually involves a late night, an open highway and the perfect number, like "Raconte, Moi Une
Historie."
35. ALISON KRAUSS AND UNION STATION  Paper Airplanes / JOHN HIATT  Dirty Jeans and
Mudslide Hymns  (old dogs, old tricks, happily so) Two veterans who stepped it up. I didn't appreciate
the Krauss for a while because the CD came "burdened" with bonus tracks that made the CD too long and
kept me from appreciating the album proper for quite a while. It took my friend Sal at Burning Wood  to
nudge me into giving the Hiatt a second chance and realizing he's strung together one of his best sincethat miracle heyday around Bring the Family.</p>
<p>36. BEASTIE BOYS  Hot Sauce Committee, Part Two  (feisty hip-hop from the old-timers) They've still
got life in them yet.
37. BEN HOWARD  Every Kingdom  (gentle pop)/ MIKE BLOOM  King Of Circles  (WARM singer-
songwriter vibe for this solo debut) Two quiet works of solid tunes that get better with each listen.</p>
<p>38. VINICIUS CANTUARIA AND BILL FRISELL  Lagrimas Mexicanas  (two great guitars, one great
voice equal haunting Latin music) A playful, delightful collaboration between the always adventurous
Frisell and the Brazilian singer and instrumentalist Cantuaria. Really charming.
39. THE GOURDS  Old Mad Joy (rootsy celebration) / MARC BROUSSARD  Marc Broussard  (bluesy</p>
<p>rock) Americana from the front porch, for then Gourds, and from the juke joint for Broussard, who has it
all to be a star except the touring and radio that once upon a time would have championed him.
40. SUZANNE VEGA  Close-Up Volume 3: State Of Being  (acoustic songs, electric songwriting) Vega
has been recording her catalog over again so she can own the masters to these new versions and profit
from them at least a little (is that asking so much for an artist?). Out of necessity has come fresh proofabout her exceptional catalog of songs and Vega's gifts as a performer. After her debut, Vega quicklyproved she was no folkie, thanks to an adventurous gift for sonic experimentation and great pop sense.But here she is stripping her songs down again mainly to a voice and a guitar. The results are gripping,mixing older and fresher tunes side by side till all you can see is the impressive breadth of her career.Plus each volume works beautifully on its own terms.</p>
<p>41. VARIOUS ARTISTS  Those Shocking, Shaking Days: Indonesia Hard, Psychedelic, Progressive
Rock and Funk (1970-1978)  (rock and roll knows no borders) Truly, rock and roll is everywhere and
always has been. If there's a better example of world music than Indonesian acts pounding out these
thumping originals back in the 1970s while singing lyrics like "I like the Rolling Stones," well I don't
know it. Is there no end to the riches produced around the world we're barely aware of much less listened
to? Apparently not.
42. VARIOUS ARTISTS  The Book of Mormon Original Cast Album  (religiously funny) I believe it's
more fun to see the show in person and some of the weaker comic numbers truly do need the context of
the show to work best. But the best numbers like "Hello," "Turn It Off" and "I Believe" are a blast to singany time. (What a great moment for Andrew Rannells on the Tonys. He and the original cast is with TheBook Of Mormon  for another year so get to it if you can.)
43. DRAKE  Take Care  (emo-rap)/ SHABAZZ PALACES  Black Up  Not a banner year for me and hip-
hop. But Drake kept compelling me to listen in to his thoughts whereas Shabazz seemed to be pushing meaway. Of course, nothing piques interest in feeling like you're not wanted.</p>
<p>44. BRAD PAISLEY  This Is Country Music  (yes it is) / STEVE EARLE  I'll Never Get Out of This
World Alive  (determined, focused country) Paisley does an amazing thing on his new album. The first
track details all the things you shouldn't do in a country song (like say the word "cancer") in a song that's
wonderfully catchy and a heartland statement of purpose. Then he spends the rest of the album doing asong about each and every "forbidden' scenario he mentioned. It's a quiet tour de force of songwriting,delivered with Paisley's typical understated charm. Earle, meanwhile, just pounds 'em out with righteousfocus and energy, a modern day Woody Guthrie.</p>
<p>45. MEGAFAUN  Megafaun  ('70s-ish rock) Dreadful name and dreadful (truly dreadful) album cover
make this exceptionally quirky album look like some anonymous Boston rip-off. They start boldly early
on with a Seventies slice of AM radio heaven called "Get Right" that goes on for eight minutes. Before andafter is a lot of great stuff that is anything but anonymous. You'd never know it from the packaging orthat stupid name.
46. FATOUMATA DIAWARA  Fatou  (Malian guitar talent combined with impeccable vocals)/
KHAIRA ARBY  Timbukto Traab  (country to Diawara's city sound) I have no idea about the actual
provenance of either act or the musical pedigree. But to my Western ear, Diawara's music sounds uptown
and sweet whereas Arby's call and response feels more downtown or rather out of town in some ruralarea. Both are striking albums any fan of world music would do well to catch.</p>
<p>47. HOUSTON PERSON  So Nice  (late period capper for understated jazz blower) I trust Person isn't
going anywhere, but this feels like a valedictory for a journeyman player given a chance to shine one more
time and delivering in spades. Here's a recent performance in New York City featuring a standard not onhis album.
48. REAL ESTATE  Days  -- (shimmering indie pop) Jersey lads delivering the pop goods with just a
dash of fading beauty.</p>
<p>49. EILEEEN JEWELL  Queen of the Minor Key  (sneakily impressive) Americana with a nod to 50s
rock and torch songs that grow on you.
50. FRANK OCEAN  nostalgia/ultra  (backward/forward looking moody pop) A trendy, hyped act that
then slipped from view for many. Like many I'm wary of hype but each dip into the water with this album
was intriguing. The really positive sign is when you return to an album months later and the first tracksounds exceptionally familiar, as if you've been playing it for weeks on end when in fact you haven'tplayed a note. That's the sign of an album that could continue to deepen and reveal itself over time.Ocean seems like a patient artist, so we should be too in listening to his music before passing judgment.</p>

very interesting list, its alwasy nice to hear a different variety of "best of" records... obviously there
were plenty of my favorites not represented (Wilco! like you said at the start...thought it was one oftheir best) i was glad to see Real Estate in there but i loved the albums by: Ryan Adams (Lucky
Now is one of the prettiest songs in years), The Decemberists put out one of their most complete
records, MY Morning Jacket's Circuital is diverse and stunning,and lets not forget The Civil Wars,one of the best sounding live acts around... and yes Radioheads album is a slow burn but i came tolove it as much as all their others in time(minus perhaps Pablo Honey:)
08:08 AM on 02/13/2012
Thanks for the list. Having a blast listening. Please ask the HP to keep it om line for a few moredays so I can enjoy the whole list. Thanks again and keep the tunes comin'.

On the eve of the grammy's, a "best of" for 2012.
12:14 AM on 02/12/2012
Two glaring omissions.
1. The Original 7ven (formally The Time), "Condensate."
2. Patrick Stump, "Soul Punk."
Two of the funkiest, hottest albums of 2011. Period.
12:33 AM on 02/12/2012
A friend of mine just saw Morris Day at the Super Bowl. I'll be sure to check both out.
Thanks for the tips.
10:36 PM on 02/11/2012
I don't buy a lot of new albums. I download a lot of singles, though. But I have heard some of these.
I've been sending my friends that Bombino video for months now. He totally jams. The MC in the
hat is classic. Same thing goes for Tinariwen's "Tenere Taqhim Tossam." Truly amazing song. I'd
urge everyone to listen to those two songs and everything else from these two acts.
Old Mad Joy continued my slight disappointment in recent Gourds efforts. It's one of their weaker
albums. I'm still waiting for them to regain that rare form on their earlier albums and Cow Fish FowlOr Pig. I'd have settled for something as good as Heavy Ornamentals, but instead got another
Haymaker.
Most this is too, ah, soft for my tastes. "El Camino" is one of the harder albums on this list. I love it.
Other harder stuff that kicks bootie include Chevelle's "Hats Off To The Bull," In Flame's "Sounds ofa Playground Fading," and Red Fang's "Murder the Mountains."
I miss good hip-hop. Loved Damian Marley and Nas' effort Distant Relatives in 2010. Anybody know
of anything that quality out since then? I'd like to try it.
12:35 AM on 02/12/2012
I know, I know, my music is def softer, but I've always favored melody over rhythm, even as
a kid. So it's not me getting old, just me being a fuddy duddy at heart. I'm late to theGourd, so don't feel the same disappointment that you and others express. It was not avintage year for hip-hop so hopefully someone will offer some good suggestions for us.

the grammys are a joke. Instead of giving the awards to the "artists" they should give them to the
publicists. 
They are the opposite of the oscars. The oscars award artistic merit. The grammys are just a
popularity contest. This is all you need to know about the grammys: Brittany Spears has been
nominated 8 times(she won once).
It would be like academy awards going to Snakes on a Plane.
06:29 PM on 02/11/2012
I would also like to add here that Tinariwen has been nominated for a Grammy. It's too bad they
cannot attend the ceremonies but for a very good reason. They have all fled the fighting in Northern
Mali that is related to the current Kel Tamashek/Taureg unrest. There is a long history to this conflict
but suffice it to say that like Omara Moctar Bombino, they are Kel Tamashek and have fled the
ethinic cleansing that has been going on in southern Mali since January 17, 2012.
12:37 AM on 02/12/2012
Thanks for the update. Very sad news in a perennially troubled region.
04:24 PM on 02/11/2012
Hmm.. No Bjork, Ladytron, The Howling Hex, Cults, Evangelista, L'il B, Pj Harvey, Radiohead? Youneed to get out of the woods more.
06:36 PM on 02/11/2012
Bebop, 
thats your personal taste. But what makes you think I should enjoy that stuff also?
10:01 AM on 02/12/2012
I'm just saying a lot a lot alot of these albums are from people who hang out in the
woods and look like Abraham Lincoln... Or worse, consider john Denver the mostinfluential rocker ever, The inclusion of one of the bands I mentioned (or gasp
skinny puppy) would have gone a long way to show a bit of diversity, never a bad
thing...
12:40 AM on 02/12/2012
I really haven't been crazy about PJ Harvey since her awe-inspiring To Bring You My Love.I keep trying but don't feel it, though obviously many many others agree with you about hernew album which topped some British polls. Radiohead was, to me, good not great, but likeBandini

all of their more abstract work it might just take some time to sink in. I'm def an OK
Computer v Kid A sort of guy. Bjork frankly I heard the music but felt it wasn't fair to judge
outside the whole app per song thingie and just didn't get a chance to experience it
properly. Heard all the rest except for Lil B, which I'll put on my to-do list. Thanks for
commenting.
09:55 AM on 02/12/2012
That's interesting about pj because i feel this album has far more to latch on to
hook wise than to bring you my love (also one of my fave albums ever). I suggest
giving it and the bjork another listen preferably in vinyl. The apps thing was red
herring, a pr misadventure at best...

Having heard very few of these, I can't compare, but two of the releases on this list that I did enjoy
are "So Beautiful or So What" by Paul Simon and "El Camino" by The Black Keys.
12:40 AM on 02/12/2012
Thanks for commenting. If you like those, I'm pretty sure you might discover some otheralbums worth checking out. Hope you sample the videos and discover something good.

At first I thought " there's going to be no mention of Barbra Streisand and the nominations shereceived because her category is not even televised ( contemporary vocal) or some such thing. Soeven though she has more Grammys then all of the above and , i might add, more talent, I thought
it was understandable that she not be mentioned ..but then after reading about these random
albums and songs that I have never heard of , I'm like ..o.k another Streisand hater ..or Anotherperson who doesn't think that Miss Streisand is relevant ..sorry but in my honest opinion she is moterelevant then all mentioned in this article!
12:46 AM on 02/12/2012
Well, I wasn't going over the Grammy categories and talking about performances and whoshould win and the such, but simply going over my favorite albums of the year. Streisand isindeed an exceptionally gifted singer and artist who towers over most everyone, not just
the people on this list. I don't truly think she's scaled the peaks since The Broadway Album
(at least, not in the studio, though the last decades have been more about liveperformances, I think). But I've still got more Streisand CDs than you can shake a stick at.Her latest didn't make my list this year, but that shouldn't brand me a hater. Glad to knowher fans are as passionate as ever.

<p>This user has chosen to opt out of the Badges programAs a huge fan of Tom Waits, I'm happy to see that you included his latest release on your Grammy
Preview. 
However, I'm a bit perplexed that Mr. Waits loses points on your list for a song that I don't even
think is on the album. You refer to a song called "Last Year". I'm guessing you mean "Last Leaf onthe Tree"? If so, I agree that it's not quite as strong as the rest of the album.
12:49 AM on 02/12/2012
Thanks for pointing that out. In condensing it down my review, I must have messed upsomewhere. He consistently delivers some of the best albums of the year, again and againbut this one is even more special than most. A real late peak. Thanks for commenting.
12:04 PM on 02/11/2012
I just recently activated my Amazon Cloud Player and uploaded all my old music. I've been jonezingfor new material however, but other than the popular music on telly and radio (of course I ownAdele's "21" and I would also include Amy Wineheart's "Back to Black" to a list of great albums) I
had no clue where to start. THANK YOU, am so happy to enjoy your blog this morning playing
gorgeous stuff from kd Lang, Clapton, Paul Simon, more favorites from the Black Keyes, andmostly, a bunch of neat stuff from artists I am not familiar with! The old gospel songs knocked meout. Saving your blog so I can check each song out at length, and will be added several to mycollection. Thank you again, I appreciate your expertise and the time you took to compile thisinformation - I will also be passing it along to other music lovers I know. Music is love. Nasmaste.

Hello Mr. Glitz. In reference to #26, Tinariwen. Do you know that they are in the middle of adevastating refugee crisis in Northern Mali right NOW???? In the past week over 60,000 civilianshave been displaced according to Reuters. Here is a msg from their facebook page. "Hi everyone.Soon after the uprising broke out last week, people started leaving the centre of our home villages,to avoid any fighting between the rebels and the Malian army. We've been out here in the bush, for
quite a few days, with many women, children and old people. Some of us are suffering from hunger
and the terrible cold. It's really very very cold at night around this time of year. Things are tough forsure, but everyone is holding up. Thanks to everyone for their thoughts and prayers for us. Keepingsending them. We really hope that everything is going to be ok. Thanks, Tinariwen."

Normally I would be inclined to say that your post is off-topic and unfair to the author andnot indulge you further.
But music (and the arts in general) allow us to connect beyond the limitations of self-
identity and I feel it is appropriate to care for the strangers with whom we connect
emotionally. I am not a religious person so I cannot offer my prayers. I offer my bestwishes, my attention and a little information:Permalink  | Share it

<p>The situation is not only one of conflict but of food shortage that is expected to get worse.
Oxfam and the International Red Cross have programmes in place in the region. 
You would do better to post at
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20120211/af-mali-refugees/
where the issue you address is the thread topic.
Whilst I understand that your comment was meant in good faith I think you place an unfair
burden on Michael Giltz.

as a 62yr old who still tries to keep up with new music and new artists i am not one to say badthhings about anyones list but how one can get to 50 artists without mentioning wild beasts Smotheror kate bush's 50 words for snow and Weeknd's house of balloons is beond my comprehension.
12:10 PM on 02/11/2012
Thanks for sharing some of your favorites from the year not on this list. The Weeknd wasobviously on a lot of lists.I liked it but haven't fallen in love yet but def will keep listening.I'm crazy for Kate Bush and enjoyed the typically quirky songs of 50 Words For Snow. But
again, for me it was a three star album out of four. I've certainly had many of her albums
on my lists over the years. I saw Wild Beasts on some UK lists but didn't catch up with itbefore the end of the year. I'll definitely check it out so thanks for the tip. With 10,000+albums out a year, there's always more to listen to.
