8/02/2005 11:26:00 AMYesterday, we talked about the far right religious radicals whodon't have the courage of their convictions -- instead ofpushing to get their religious beliefs taught in school, they lieand dissemble and pretend that "intelligent design" is a scienceand that Bible study is just a non-partisan look at the Bible asa work of literature. In short, they lie.Today, we see the same thing in two prominent politicians whodon't deserve the support of either party.First, Republican New York Gov. George Pataki backtracked ona long record of supporting reproductive rights to veto theavailability of a morning-after pill without a prescription. Bothsides are attacking him and no one believes Pataki's claim hejust wants to protect the kids. It's clearly a cynical ploy to tryand boost his standing among the arch conservatives whodominate the primaries.Second, Mass. Gov. Mitt Romney -- who somehow conned thatbluest of states into thinking he was a moderate -- went evenmore extreme. Romney labeled the morning after pill an"abortion pill" and said abortion shouldn't be legal. However, toget elected in the first place, Romney pretended he believedabortion should be safe and legal and that he supported the"substance" of Roe v. Wade. The 58 year old governor wants usto believe his position on abortion has "evolved and deepened."Romney has also attacked equal rights for gays, turned hisback on a gay relative and made political hay out of the factthat a relative died long ago from a botched abortion whenthey were illegal. Other things Romney once said:In another 2002 survey, from the National Abortion RightsAction League Pro-Choice Massachusetts, Mr. Romneywrote: "I respect and will protect a woman's right tochoose. This choice is a deeply personal one. Womenshould be free to choose based on their own beliefs, notmine and not the government's."In the past, Mr. Romney has also voiced support foremergency contraception, telling The Boston Herald in1994, "I think it would be a positive thing to have womenhave the choice of taking the morning-after pill."I've been wondering how this guy was elected the governor ofMassachusetts. Well, it's simple. He lied.Don't these people have the courage of their convictions? No, they'reliars. And think about what Romney and Pataki are trying to do toappeal to the far right. They're not just opposing abortion, they'reopposing CONTRACEPTION. That's how radical the far right truly is.Yes, people can change, but craven politicians who lie to get intooffice or lie to curry favor are pathetically obvious.
