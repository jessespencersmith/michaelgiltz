For The Holidays

Peanuts , arguably the most popular and influential
comic strip of all time, continues to flourish -- especially
during the holidays. From Halloween through
Christmas, Peanuts  TV specials pepper the airwaves
and are watched endlessly on DVD. The music of VinceGuaraldi is a constant on the radio. Peanuts -related
merchandise like calendars, t-shirts, mugs and toys fill
the stores. And of course classic editions of the strip
continue to appear in newspapers worldwide. So it's
only fitting that the late Charles Schulz would have
celebrated his 87th birthday on Thanksgiving Day.
The best way to celebrate Schulz and his work is the
ongoing series being published by Fantagraphics . The latest volume -- The Complete Peanuts, 1973-1974
($28.99; Fantagraphics) -- is a lovingly produced volume that includes every strip from those two years
in a handsome hardcover book designed by Seth.

<p>Like earlier editions, it's a thrill to read the strip chronologically and in one fell swoop. You get a far
better sense of Schulz's creative zig-zagging as he suddenly and unexpectedly finds himself at the tip of a
pop culture juggernaut. At this stage in the Seventies, Peanuts  has become a phenomenon and will soon
turn into an institution, with all the resting on laurels that implies. It's a bit of a shock to realize Schulz
isn't even halfway through his run, which went from 1950 to early 2000, a remarkable 49 years in all.Yes, after 23 years, Schulz had made every artistic breakthrough that was in him and the rest wasconsolidation and the relaxation that comes with success. But the Seventies are the salad days, with the
soft decline of the 80s and 90s (inevitable and not without their rewards) still ahead.
Schulz still has some bite, such as the brilliant story arc in which Charlie Brown wears a sack over his
head to summer camp because he's got an embarrassing discoloration on his head. To his astonishment,Charlie Brown discovers that when no one knows his identity he is suddenly popular. Sports of course
remain a constant, with football and baseball and ice skating all mined for laughs. But tennis -- which
boomed in popularity in the Seventies thanks to Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Chris Evert and manymore -- seems the defining sport of this period.
As always, Fantagraphics pairs each volume with a celebrity introduction and in this case it's perfect:
Schulz's long-time friend and tennis legend Billie Jean King. (Her birthday, by the way, is on November22, just four days before Schulz.)
King won a remarkable 39 Grand Slam titles, including 12 singles titles and has been an ardent supporterof women's rights both in sports and society at large. So it's touching to read that while she was traveling
the globe King found comfort in discovering Peanuts  in the local newspapers and a special thrill when
Sparky -- as Schulz was known to his friends and loved ones -- mentioned her by name. She writes:
From time to time, Sparky included me in Peanuts . A particular favorite of mine had Peppermint Patty
telling Marcie, "Has anyone ever told you that when you're mad, you look just like Billie Jean King?"Trust me: my friends had a heyday with that one.
Sparky referenced me several times in Peanuts  and it was his way of letting me know that we needed
to talk or just catch up with one another. He rarely phoned me, but when he wanted to check in, he

(VIDEO)dropped a reference in Peanuts  because we both knew I would read it every day I could. So I would
call him and we would talk and then -- you know what? -- life was better.
They originally bonded over their mutual support of Title IX, the groundbreaking law that has changed
the face of our society. But that was just the start of the friendship between King and Sparky.
While it may have been our mutual support of Title IX and our shared enjoyment of tennis thatinitially brought us together, it was a common love for life that kept us close through the years. Sparkytaught me to be truthful and through his comic strip he shared his real life experiences with each of us
on a daily basis.
Sparky was Charlie Brown. He was not a real talkative man, but was definitely a very deep thinker. It
was when he put a pen in his hand and went to work on a Peanuts  comic strip he became insightful
and poetic, and truly exposed himself to the world.
In their work together and the careers they forged, both Schulz and King made an impact on society that
still reverberates today. Billie Jean King's work is ongoing.  Schulz's legacy is Peanuts  and it's being
presented beautifully in the ongoing series by Fantagraphics . And their impact on each other is captured
nicely in King's warm words. It's a fitting tribute to a fellow legend.

Wasn't it Fall of 1973 when Billie Jean King faced off with Bobby Riggs? One of those events where
us oldsters would have to describe to the youngsters what happened and then stare at our feet aswe try to explain why some people believed it was important that women athletes have theirprofession al accomplish ments smacked down and why some of us cheered so loudly when King
quieted "The Mouth." (I seem to recall that was Riggs' nickname.)
With the arguable exception of that kid that Peppermint Patty traded to Charlie Brown's team for the
funny round nosed kid (Snoopy), the best athlete in the strip was the aforementi oned PP. That was
so cool.TOP VIDEO PICKS

Billie.
I still have the last Peanuts strip hanging by my computer. Hard to believe it's been nearly 10 years.
Charlie Brown (and Sparky) will live forever.
The Fantagraph ics sets have been incredible . I remember years ago when the company first
announced the project; I was awestruck. These books are a must for Peanuts fans. They're so well
made, so lovingly produced.
