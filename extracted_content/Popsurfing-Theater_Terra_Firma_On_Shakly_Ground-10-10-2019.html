THEATER: "Terra Firma" Is On Shaky Ground
TERRA  FIRMA  ** out of ****
THE  COOP   AT  BARUCH  PERFORMING  ARTS  CENTER  
Terra  Firma  is a muddled allegory of a play by Barbara Hammond. It
features a hugely impressive physical presentation, but that can't
compensate for several flaws. Acting styles range all over the map,basic information is withheld from the audience without cause and thesetting is fundamentally wrong.
The plot is simple, even fable-like, though it's closer to one of those
dark and disturbing Grimm tales, not the sort of story that ends with"and they all lived happily ever after."
In the not-so-distant-future, a group of people live on a gigantic steel
platform somewhere out on the "Vast Sea." It's an abandoned relicfrom earlier days (a War era naval defense platform, per the shownotes). The three inhabitants style themselves a Queen (AndrusNichols), a King (Gerardo Rodriguez) and Jones (John Keating), a
Citizen.
Their impromptu world is invaded by a man known only as the
Hostage (Tom O'Keefe). The Hostage says he's a fisherman but whocan be certain? The inhabitants of this platform call it Terra Firma and
feel beset on all sides. It's one of eight such platforms they can spy in
the vicinity and the others are exploding into bits, the victims of somenefarious enemy, they believe. The Hostage might in fact be a Spy! Andso they keep him tied up and under guard, with occasional breaks for agame of chess.
Paranoid, scared, defensive and longing for attention, the people of
Terra Firma simply don't know what to do about the Hostage or muchof anything. They slip messages into bottles and toss those into the sea,MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

THEATER: "Terra Firma" Is On</p>
<p>wondering if anyone will ever acknowledge their existence. They long
for the return of their children, the Prince and Princess who left some
time ago. And every once in a while another explosion rocks theirworld and another platform is blown into bits. Are they next?
Soon, Prince Teddy (Daniel Molina) clambers back on board, though
where he's been and what he's seen is barely hinted at. Then anotherstranger appears, a self-styled Diplomat who found one of theirmessages and tracked them down. He offers his services as negotiatorfor the Hostage, though adding that a crust of bread would also be
quite welcome. What follows are multiple games of chess, fireworks, a
boxing match, a pistol (fired, as per Chekhov) and the spooky fallingof ash, accompanied by a reference to nuclear winter.
We spend most of the show simply wondering what is going on. At
some points it leans toward Beckett, at others a satirical comedy, butnever much of anything for long. And once Terra  Firma  reveals its
hand by telling the audience what the characters have known all along,it has nothing else to say and ends.

One can't praise the technical elements of this show enough, a realcredit to the hotly anticipated new theater company The Coop. The
playwright certainly can't complain about her work's presentation.
However, the real-world specificity of the set works against the show'sinclination towards absurdity and allegory. (It's no coincidence thescript begins with a quote from Gulliver's  Travels. ) Still, the physical
production is a triumph.
The stage is filled with a massive steel platform solidly placed on top of
giant round cement pillars. We're told it rises 60 feet above sea leveland you never doubt its solidity and immense presence. A rickety
staircase leads skyward on the right, with one step tilting dangerously
down. Each cement tower houses unseen lower decks, including aspiral staircase on the right and a more cellar-like entrance on the left.Even better is the curved screen that hugs the entire stage, depicting avast and beautiful ocean as far as the eye can see. The effect is
wonderfully convincing.Shaky Ground

<p>That scenic triumph is by Andrew Boyce and it works hand in hand
with all the other tech elements. The lighting by Eric Southern is a
treat, from explosions to fireworks to the simple but necessarysuggestion of life on the water. Ditto the sound design of Jane Shaw,which is just as essential for bringing this world to life without ever
calling attention to itself. (Though I must admit, I did tend to look
around wondering if there was an actual cat wandering around.) Thecostumes by Ntokozo Fuzunina Kunene similarly manage to berealistic and yet attuned to each character's plight. Even the fightchoreography by Carman Lacivita is a treat. Realistic fights are never
easy to do under the best of circumstances; here she has the added
challenge of actors tumbling around the lip of a platform with a prettyserious drop to the ground below.
That's where the consistency ends. The actors seem in warring camps
when it comes to style and one must blame the director Shana Cooperand more to the point a story that doesn't know what it wants to be.
Nichols is the Queen and she's been a treat on stage before. Here she
walks around in a comic opera style, her hand raised high in the air tomaintain a self-defeating "royal" air. That mild absurdity is echoed byT. Ryder Smith as the Diplomat. They're good but seem in a different
show from the rest.
Tom O'Keefe is closer to them as the Hostage, thanks to a shifty
accent, but he seems to exist in the real world. As does the inestimableJohn Keating as the citizen Jones. Invariably at home in any setting,
Keating is a solid center here. The playwright doesn't always know
what to do, but his character is never in doubt. Less can be said aboutRodriguez as the King and Molina as Teddy since it's never clear whatsort of people they're meant to be. They're not comic figures of even a
modest sort like the Queen and the Diplomat. But they aren't flesh and
bone either, like the Hostage or Jones. They barely register at all.
How much blame can one place on the notes in the program? It goes
to great lengths to describe the inspiration Hammond took from thereal world "country" of Sealand, an abandoned WW II military
platform now claimed as the smallest nation in the world by its
precious few inhabitants. That platform has been the site of a pirateradio station servicing the UK, pitched battles both real and legal andultimately the "founding" of Sealand complete with Constitution and
national anthem.
The media loves the place, needless to say. You can learn about its
story everywhere from the movies to countless newspaper articles andthe new book The  Outlaw  Ocean  by New York Times reporter Ian
Urbina. (He devotes a chapter to Sealand.) Hammond even used agrant to visit the platform herself and soak up its history and anarchicspirit. I can't imagine why since the real story of Sealand doesn'tinform the fanciful play in the least.</p>
<p>She doesn't quite mock our brutal desire for nationalism above
humanity. And she doesn't quite skewer how people reject society a la
Burning Man...and then inevitably start to recreate that society in
their own brave new world. All she does is give us people trapped in a
strange, perhaps desperate situation that teeters between reality andfantasy.   We don't quite grasp their predicament until the very end. In
this case, withholding information from the audience doesn't create
poignancy, just annoyance.
Here's the problem. Sealand represents a rejection  of the real world,
an escape from a stultifying life. You don't get trapped on Sealand; you
choose  Sealand. It's a powerful symbol of nonconformity. And it makes
no sense as a setting for a post-apocalyptic story, where characters by
definition are forced into desperate straits. You can't turn your back onthe world if the world no longer exists. Better to have played out thisstory on the iconic "island" of countless cartoons and comics, a moundof land with a lone coconut tree floating in the midst of an empty sea.That would be a start. But then Hammond would need to figure out
what story she wants to tell, rather than just hinting at it.
