THEATER: "Ain't No Mo'" Takes Off With Talent
and Smarts
AIN'T  NO  MO'  *** 1/2 out of ****
THE  PUBLIC  THEATER
If I tell you how funny Ain't  No  Mo'  is, I worry that might diminish
how angry it is. If I tell you how angry it is, that might diminish how
smart it is. If I tell you how smart it is, you might not realize howfunny it is. So I'll just tell you how good it is. Very good, very funny,
very angry, very smart and very everything else you hope for from a
committed, exciting play by a new talent (Jordan E. Cooper) who alsodelivers a high-wire act of a performance as the airline gate attendant,Peaches. Yes, he does. Go.
The conceit of this kaleidoscope of a play is that time's up in America
for black people. The U.S. government is offering a one-way ticket toyour country of choice in Africa and making the very  strong
suggestion to get going while the going is good. As a bonus, the captainof the plane from African American Airlines is former President
Barack Obama. ("We found him!" shouts one of the characters.) Other
people of color? Well, the Hispanics and Latinos are on stand-by, butthe last flight out is filling fast.
It begins with an uproarious spoof of an African American funeral.
The overly enunciated preacher mopping his brow, the church ladies
speaking in tongues and offering an "amen," the fiery speech -- all arepresent and accounted for. And who is being buried? That would beMr. Right To Complain. Yes, once Obama became President, the ideathat black people no longer had the Right To Complain became gospel.
In one fell swoop, Cooper mocks our cinematic conception of a Tyler
Perry-like black funeral, the idea that Obama's election changedeverything and the small fragile hope that it might actually be true. Ohand he makes us laugh while giving a ridiculously talented cast the firstof many chances to shine.MICHAEL GILTZ AT WORK

<p>And we're off. Cooper offers a string of skits, one scathing and
scabrous and unforgiving but humane take-down after another of
racism and the privileged and white society and how your own
community can sometimes be its own worst enemy.
A reality TV show about "baby mamas" features   a light-skinned
woman who is touted as the world's first person to transition from one
race to another. (I think Rachel Dolezal beat her, though.)
A line of women patiently wait for their chance to abort their babies
before society can torture and squeeze the life out of the child on its
own terms.
A rich family is bemused by the offer to leave the country (why would
they leave when they're so respected and accepted?) but a tad worriedabout the disappearance of all their servants.
And punctuating it all, the scene at the airport gate where Peaches
maintains order amidst the chaos of that final flight.
It's a raucous, sobering work that's also balanced and generous. Most
every actor gets a show-stopping bit of comedy and a moment to baretheir humanity. Time and anger a righteous bit of speechifying pops in
right after some over-the-top humor and it works 99% of the time.
Director Stevie Walker-Webb and his entire creative team (especiallythe costumes of Montana Levi Blanco   working in concert with the
hair, makeup and wig designs of Cookie Jordan) do marvelous work in
supporting the text and the actors on stage to make that happen.
My one caveat is that Cooper felt the need to underline   and italicize
the finale when his play was already so powerful.   Did he worry a la
Dave Chappelle that we would be laughing a little too loud and
perhaps not always at precisely the right moment or in the right way?
Just to make sure we get it, his character Peaches strips down and thesound design tosses in rolling thunder (or tolling bells, I can't quite becertain) at the end. Then he drops a giant American flag so the castcan stand soberly in front of it, more a line-up than a curtain call. It's
as if he didn't quite trust us enough, that we'd let him down. To be
fair, if history and current events are any judge, he's probably right.
