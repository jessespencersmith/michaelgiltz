GOing, Going ... 
Winter always cuts a swath through the the­
ater, claiming any frail shows for its own_ 
Last year, 
the drop in tempera­
ture-and its atten­
dant drop in atten­
dance-even threat­
ened the life of that 
hardy Off Broadway 
survivor The FantJJs­
ticks_ Nineteen nine­
ty-five is no excep­
tion, with three shows calling it quits and a fourth­
Damn Yankees-hoping to cheat death by going into 
hibernation until February 28_ Close out the year by 
catching them while you can. 
Show Closing Date 
Damn Yankees 12131194 
Why tough it out during the frozen months of January and Febru­
ary? The producers of this musical decided it was smarter-and 
cheaper-to go on hiatus until February 28, when Jerry Lewis 
makes his Broadway debut as the Devil, taking over for the depart­
ing Victor Garber. 
Passion 1fl /95 
Closing just eight months after it opened, Stephen Sondheim's inti­
mate musical about obsessive love, like many of his shows, will 
doubtless prove more commercial when revived a few years down 
the road. It's set to open in London in the fall of '9S. 
Guys and Dolls 1/8/95 
The happy case of a Broadway show that succeeded commercially 
and critically. It garnered great reviews, ran for more than two and 
a half years, and had the good taste to close shop just before best­
ing the 1,200-performance mark of the revered original. 
Carousel 1/15/95 
Director Nicholas Hytner will see his brooding, acclaimed revival of 
the Rodgers & Hammerstein classic close on Broadway just as his 
debut film-17Ie Madness of King Geo~e-opens in theaters 
around the country. Carousel premiered March 24 to strong busi­
ness and even stronger reviews, but Uncoln Center decided to 
close it rather than unde~o the cost of bringing in new cast mem­
bers, moving the show to another house, and weathering the 
reduced box office of winter.</p>
