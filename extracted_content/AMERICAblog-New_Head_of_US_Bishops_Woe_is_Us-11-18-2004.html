11/18/2004 07:42:00 PMThe blockheaded new leader of the US Catholic Church -- whohas just declared bankruptcy so his region can avoid paying thefull price for harboring, protecting and defending pedophiles --just gave his first press conference.One of Bishop William Skylstad's first comments? According toUSA Today:"Acknowledging "tension" between his responsibilities to hisdiocese and his role as leader of the bishops' group, Skylstadsaid, "It's been a tough time for bishops, honestly, a verytough time.""A tough time for bishops? BISHOPS? Not for the parishionerswho saw their private church records turned over to Republicanhacks to contact voters? Not for people of faith who sawbishops roaming the country trying to stir up votes for apresidential candidate who defied the Pope and launched a warthe Pontiff declared immoral, a candidate who defied theChurch and executed more people as governor (including thementally retarded) than anyone else in history in the sameamount of time? And most of all, not a difficult time for thevictims of rape who finally found the courage to come forwardand were treated as a nuisance or as money-grubbing peopletrying to bilk the Church out of funds?But in fact a difficult time for bishops. Skylstad clearly is in nomood to reach out or seek pastorally what the people of theChurch are thinking and feeling. God help us practicingCatholics.
