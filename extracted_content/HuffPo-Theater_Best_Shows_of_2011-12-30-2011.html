2011 RECAP -- THE BEST SHOWS OF THE YEARTalking about the best shows of the calendar year feels a bit odd since the theater season runs from the
fall through the spring. That's why Tony Awards are held in June. But the calendar is king so it's time fora best of the year wrap-up. I've seen 165 theatrical events this year (including every new show onBroadway), an average of more than three a week. I always make an annual list of my favorite movies (Isee hundreds), albums (I listen to hundreds), TV shows and books. But I've never made a list of my
favorite theater shows because I've never seen enough of the big events to pass judgment. You can't name
the best films of the year if you haven't at least seen The Descendants  and Tree Of Life  and A Separation.
How could you name your favorite shows if you hadn't seen The Book Of Mormon?  This year I have. It's
a rare privilege and I know it.
First, most people simply couldn't afford to go to that many shows even if they wanted to. Second unless
you live in New York City, your options are severely limited in the US, with the rare exception of theater
towns like Chicago. Great live theater can (and should) be seen all over the country but New York City
and London are still meccas. Third, I get to see the shows in ideal seats. Not since I was on staff (briefly)at New York  magazine in the 1990s have I had this much access to theater.
So believe me when I say I know how lucky I am. Thanks to all the publicity firms and shows thataccommodated me this year. Thanks to all the artists who put in the hard work to create the shows. It
should be clear from my reviews that I like championing a good show much more than ripping apart a
bad one. When something doesn't work, it's agony for actors to have to go onstage and face that factnight after night. (I only have to face it once.) Even a spectacle like Spiderman: Turn Off The Dark  that
clearly has its eyes on being a blockbuster is a labor of love for all involved that means years of hard work.So my negative reviews try to be constructive. I'm no show doctor but if I can encourage the elements
that do work and see some way towards making a show better, why not speak up?
THE BEST THEATER OF 2011
1. Sons Of The Prophet  -- the best play of the year with the best cast. Stephen Karam is the real deal. I
paid to see it when money was tight and it was the happiest purchase I made this year.
2. Once  -- a show that seemed a rather iffy idea delivers beautifully; here's hoping they make it even
better when transferring it to Broadway
3. Sleep No More  -- Punchdrunk's work is always gripping but this immersive extravaganza spin on
Macbeth  is the most welcome hit of the year
4. The Interminable Suicide Of Gregory Church  -- Daniel Kitson's one-man show was my first
chance to experience his considerable skill. He returns to St. Ann's Warehouse in January in a new show.
Buy your tickets immediately.
5. PigPen Theatre Co.'s The Mountain Song and Nightmare Story  -- these guys formed their
troupe at Carnegie Mellon. Their shows combine some of my favorite elements -- folk tales, Americanamusic, puppetry -- into moving, whimsical and charming works that show them bursting with talent andideas. One played at FringeFest in Manhattan and the other in Brooklyn and I would have gladly gone tothe other three boroughs to see them three more times. Can't wait to see what they do next. Word is
they'll be coming to Off Broadway in 2012 with a new show.
6. All's Well That Ends Well  at the Globe in London -- the Globe is one of my favorite theatrical
haunts in the world, thanks to rock bottom prices (five pounds if you can stand in the pit, which happento be the best seats) and great quality. But this peerless production directed by John Dove and with amatchless cast headed by Ellie Percy was a marvel from top to bottom.7. The School For Lies  -- David Ives had a banner year, but I'd argue this brilliant adaptation of
Moliere's The Misanthrope at Classic Stage Company was the peak, thanks to brilliance all around, led byactors Mamie Gummer and Hamish Linklater. Tremendous fun I wish I could see again. 
8. Peter and The Starcatcher  - People went crazy over the inventive staging of Cymbeline by Theatre
For A New Audience, which I enjoyed. But I thought director Roger Rees did an even better, similar job
in creating this tale about Peter Pan with the simplest and most pleasing theatrical devices. A winner.Another show I paid to see and thrilled to have done so. It's coming to Broadway in the spring so don't
miss out.
9. Three Sisters  -- another winner for Classic Stage Company, which had a great year, to say the least.
Chekhov is exceptionally hard to get right but this production did it, led by Maggie Gyllenhaal, JulietRylance, Jessica Hecht and Peter Sarsgaard with subtle direction by Austin Pendleton. (I'm stillheartbroken I missed his musical A Minister's Wife  with Bobby Steggert.) No review because I paid to see
it, knowing that CSC is one of the safest bets in town.10. The Book Of Mormon  -- yes, it's very funny indeed and for me the show soars emotionally and
comedically thanks to Andrew Rannells as Elder Price.

RetweetOh man. Gorgeous, touching
obituary for Tony Scott by
@KevinFCorrigan . This one's a gut-
punch: http://t.co/ajVp7K1L</p>
<p>Goes but for my money this was the crowd-pleasing revival of the year. It's a great show with a terrific
score and book that needs no "updating." And it was given a sterling production headed by Daniel
Radcliffe, who definitely gets the award for Most Improved after Equus. He'll never be a belter but he
held the stage with ease and light comedy is right up his alley. This is the show I sent tourists to againand again. Now if only I could see Darren Criss take it over for a month....12. Septimus & Clarissa  -- an illuminating re-imagining of Virginia Woolf's masterpiece Mrs.
Dalloway , this is the best adaptation of Woolf I've ever seen on stage or screen. ( Vita & VIrginia  ranks
alongside it, though that's not strictly based on her work, but her letters.) It's a triumph for star and
playwright Ellen McLaughlin and director Rachel Dickstein.
13. Blanche: The Bittersweet Life Of A Wild Prairie Dame  -- I walked out of this charming pocket
musical based on the life of the creator's grandmother determined to tell people to rush and see thisoffering at the New York Musical Theatre Festival before it disappeared...only to find out that the finalshow was just a few hours later. The heartbreak and beauty of live theater (it's there and then it's gone)brought home again. Bittersweet indeed.14. One Man, Two Guvnors  -- this rollicking London comedy has stayed in my mind. I enjoyed the
British audience's thunderous appreciation even more than I enjoyed the show itself. It's coming toBroadway in April and promises to be one of the real wild cards of the season. James Corden is going to
be the hardest working man on Broadway now that Hugh Jackman is done.
15. Catch Me If You Can  -- A real puzzle. Why did so many people dismiss or play down this show,
even Tony voters who should have appreciated the craft on display? It made clear that Aaron Tveit is aBroadway star triple threat (four if you count his handsome looks). While the score is not as solid asHairspray, every other element is top-notch from the terrific book to the smashing sets, costumes,choreography and ensemble. This is how Broadway is done. An ideal sexy show for businessmen who
don't like musicals (how often can they see Jersey Boys?), it inexplicably came and went. Too bad. 
16. Arcadia  -- This revival was also passed over by many but I love Tom Stoppard and it was a treat to
see Billy Crudup tackle another role after seeing him in the original Broadway production. A major workfrom a major playwright presented with care.17. Follies  -- what a curious show. I think this production is the best I've ever seen and it's bursting with
great talent and great songs but I still think it could be done even better and the static second act brought
further to life. Yet I'd love to see it again before it goes.
18. War Horse -- My favorite show for bragging rights since I could compare the Broadway production
to the London version I saw a year or two earlier. Far superior to the Steven Spielberg film and indeed
even the book. 
19. Hand To God  -- A show about a sock puppet possessed by the devil? A fun cast led by an inspired
Steven Boyer make it work. But here's hoping they keep working on it to make a fun play that stays inyour mind even better before transferring to Off Broadway.20. Hugh Jackman: Back On Broadway  -- I was afraid not to include it. If I didn't, Jackman might
just show up at my apartment and perform the entire show in my living room until he'd won me over justlike he wins over every single member of the audience every single night. Now let's get him into an
honest-to-goodness musical so he can really shine.

A agree about Follies. As we used to say, I loved it but I didn't love it love it. I wanted it to be great,
and it was good enough to round up to wonderful despite a few non-fatal shortcomings. 
I saw the stand-by for Carlotta, Florence Lacey I think, and her "I'm Still Here" was perfect. I could
have used a few more perfect moments in the show.
02:27 PM on 01/06/2012
Thanks for sharing. I'd love to see it done intimately and stripped down without all thetrappings the original staging called for. Maybe that's why the concert versions are sosuccessful.
07:52 AM on 01/03/2012
Sons of the Prophet really is good isn't it? I've been telling everyone to see it and Follies. Did yousee Unnatural Acts? I think for me it was the best thing I saw in 2011. I natter about it here:http://heresheisboys.com/2011/08/20/unnatural-acts/
02:33 PM on 01/06/2012
Yes, I did and I liked Unnatural Acts. I recommended Sons Of The Prophets verysuccessfully -- everyone I insisted go see it liked it very much. Thanks for sharing your
comments.
09:32 PM on 01/01/2012
Michael I agree with most of your reviews but I do not believe War Horse belongs in the top 20.
Handspring did a brilliant job on the puppets but aside from the scenery, lighting and sound designeverybody else did a lousy job. I loved Morpurgo's novel but the stage adaptation was barelyplayable, indeed none of the cast were capable of making it playable at the Lincoln Centre. I knowstanding ovations in America are cheap and often automatic, but those nightly ovations at the VivianBeaumont Theatre are utterly unearned.
02:35 PM on 01/06/2012
Standing ovations are indeed quite common. When a show doesn't get one, boy you reallyknow it isn't working. Did you see the London production? I thought the cast was strongerthere. But I am a sucker for puppetry and while I did move it way down on my list (it's #18),I couldn't deny it as a technical marvel with flashes of emotion. What did you think of thefilm? I think it's just terrible and ham-handed.Recency   | Popularity

The Select (The Sun Also Rises) ERS at *NYTW* not Public in 2011

Thanks very much for pointing that out. I've corrected it. Obviously I conflated that run with
their GATZ at the Public last year.

The Select the Sun also rises was playing at NYTW in 2011

Although it could only run for 2 performances, The Spidey Project created quite a stir and was greatfun!

I guess "Good People" was actually part of last season, but it was one of the best plays I've seen inyears. "Master Class" may have been considered last season as well, but Tyne Daley slayed it. Itwas a privilege to watch her perform.
"Venus in Fur" is powerful stuff. Great acting. "Relatively Speaking" is fun, but not particularly memorable. Ethan Cohen's play wasn't all that
great. It was more like an over-stretched SNL sketch. Elaine May's play was very good. WoodyAllen's play was lightweight, but hilarious.

Thanks for commenting. I was covering the year in theater, not the "season," which as youknow stretches from fall to spring. So as you can see from my list of all the shows I sawthis calendar year, both Good People and Master Class were part of this roundup. I wouldcertainly have remembered Tyne Daly if doing a rundown of best performances. Manypeople admired Good People just as much as you though for me it was more of a mixedexperience. You can see my reviews by clicking on these links. At the bottom of the revieware all my shows and links to all the reviews. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-

<p>What I'd like to know most, is how can I get your "luck?". Just my idea of heaven--3 shows a week
with a mandatory trip to London!

I am lucky!

Saw HTSIB last night and thought it was truly awful. Having seen the first 2 renditions...and Morse
does OWN the role...I was very disappointed. How can you say that....he doesn't sing well, he
doesn't dance well etc. and still call him good in this role? Who is paying for such a review? John
and Bartlett OWN this show.....they are so much better than "Harry" the lighweight.

How lucky of you to have seen Robert Morse in the original production (unless you meant
the film?). I can imagine how anyone would pale in comparison to that gold standard. Whatdid you think of the Matthew Broderick revival? I enjoyed that one a great deal as well. Isaw Daniel Radcliffe in Equus and this role is clearly a much better fit but I also felt he hadimproved greatly. You're certainly not alone. Anything Goes (which i was not a fan of) gotall the love from the Tonys compared to HTSIB and Radcliffe was not nominated. Did any
of my other reviews gibe more with your taste or are we just polar opposites?
