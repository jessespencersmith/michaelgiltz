            <p>TalUt . "ulp's Bible Lesson 
In Pulp FICIion, hit man Jules !Samuel L Jackson) first scares 
the hell out of his victims by quoting a particularly righteous 
passage from the Bible. Then he slaughters them. Jackson, 
who's now filming Die Hard New York, was recalling the lines 
with relish the other day from an Upper West Side set. "I think 
it pumps him up to do the things he does," Jackson said about 
his "wrath of God" speech from Ezekiel. "H's used the way Die 
Walkiire was in Apocalypse Now." Director Quentin Tarantino 
has Jules repeating the passage again and again, turning it from 
a terrifying sermon into 
an uncomfortably comic 
signal that some poor 
dupe is about to be 
offed. Ironically, the 
speech loses its impact 
on the audience just as 
it begins to have an 
effect on Jules. 
"Towards the end, Jules 
really does give it some 
thought," says the 45· 
year·old actor. "He's 
had the power of life and 
death all his life. And all 
of a sudden it's taken away. H really does cause him to think." 
Jackson, best known for his Cannes and New York Film Critics 
Circle winning performance in Jungle Fever, must have God on 
his side when it! comes to film projects. Along with the next Die 
Hard, he's just finished a child·custody drama called Losing Isa­
iah with his wife, actress La Tanya Richardson. And life as the 
Scripture-quoting Jules may not be over, either. "Quentin's say· 
ing he might even do a Jules·walks-the-Earth movie," 
says Jackson. MICHAEl. Guz</p>
