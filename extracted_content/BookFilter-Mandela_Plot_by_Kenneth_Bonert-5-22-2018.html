A vibrant, propulsive literary thriller that charts the high-stakes

lost its wayâ As the 1980s draw to a close, South Africa is a maelstrom of
political violence with the apartheid regime in its death throes. YoungMartin Helger is the struggling odd duck at an elite private boys school in
Johannesburg, with his father a rough-handed scrap dealer and his brother
a mysterious legend. When a beautiful and manipulative American arrivesat the family home, Martin soon finds himself wrenched out of his isolatedbubble and thrust into the raw heart of the struggle. At the same time,secrets from the past begin to emerge and old sins long buried return in
terrifying new ways, tearing at the Helgers, a second-generation Jewish
family, even as the larger forces of history and politics tear apart thecountry as a whole. Mercy is in short supply and ultimately Martin mustrely on alternative strengths to protect himself and fight for a better
future. From the acclaimed author of the National Jewish Book Award–
winning debut novel The Lion Seeker,  The Mandela Plot is at once a
riveting literary thriller, a moving coming of age tale, and anunforgettable journey through a world that entertains and terrifies inequal measure, and holds profound resonance  for the present moment.

What We Say
Kenneth Bonert's second novel has a setting of time and place that's so weighty it can feel crushing. Our hero Martin is a
Jewish teenager growing up in apartheid South Africa. His family has just enough money to send him to an elite privateschool for Jews, but not quite enough money to make him accepted there. Martin's father is decent to his black workers,
but not enough to avoid the threat of unions and radicals or the unwitting stain of his paternalistic attitude. The boy'sShare This Book

<p>brother is a hard case who turned his back on the safety of university and essentially volunteered for the military at a time
when it was engaged in deeply oppressive and brutal battles. And really all Martin wants to do is get closer to the new
white American college student staying with them -- pity she turns out to be an activist teaching blacks at a school in the
townships. From random violence to anti-Semitism to the disdain of his "betters," Martin simply can't get a break. His worldreally is filled with landmines -- both literal and figurative -- and every choice he makes is rife with moral complexity.Bonert captures the claustrophobic, dangerous atmosphere of the time with impressive weight; honestly, Martin's optionswere all poor and you felt dreadful for him, even as he did things that made you like him less. The darkness closes in and
Martin's grasp on reality becomes unmoored and this book melted down in impressive fashion. It's a pity to report that the
book becomes too cinematic in the final act. The bigger in scope it reached for, the less convincing it proved. Martin is avery memorable character and for a while the poisonous environment seeped off the page in impressive fashion. That willlinger long after the fireworks of the finale fizzled out. -- Michael Giltz
What Others Say
A Publisher’s Lunch “Emerging Voice”
A New York Post  "Must-Read Book"
"This is fiction that illuminates shifting allegiances and power struggles during a dark time and place in recenthistory. A riveting thriller with a solid historical base."—Booklist , Starred Review
"The Mandela Plot  is as suspenseful as a thriller, and the truest kind of Jewish family story—suffused with love
and secrets both. It's also a masterful, terrifying portrait of a nation, at once bewitching and brutal, whose years
on the edge have so much to teach America, and the world, today.  You won't be able to put this book down."
—Boris Fishman, author of A Replacement Life  and Don’t Let My Baby Do Rodeo
“Propulsive, bare-boned, and riveting,  The Mandela Plot  shows how competing loyalties to family, truth, and
history can tear a person—and a country—apart. Kenneth Bonert’s unvarnished characters are fierce andsurprising—there are no seat belts  on this ride.”
 —Rachel Kadish, author of  The Weight of Ink
“Chaim Potok meets Leon Uris: a solid […] portrait of violence and renewal.”
—Kirkus Reviews
"It’s the late 1980s in South Africa, where an awkward boy named Martin struggles to find a place at an elite
private school in Johannesburg. A beautiful American activist comes to live with Martin at his family home, andshe makes him see his own chaotic, changing country through a new lens."—New York Post , "This week's must-read books"
