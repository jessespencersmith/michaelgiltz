6/05/2005 05:32:00 PMThe debacle over Iraq -- misleading the public, using fear tokeep a populace in check, using terror alerts for politicalpurposes when no threat was in sight -- seemed to have noeffect. Bush and Blair and other major political figures werereturned to office.But now their power seems to be crumbling before our eyes.Right after Blair's party was reelected (in a historic third termthat was also at historically low levels), many were calling forhis head. Step down, they said. Blair caved in to reality, butmanaged to convince everyone he should stay on till the UKvoted on the EU constitution in mid 2006. Now that thereferendum is dead, his own party members are braying againfor Blair to step down. What exactly is he waiting for, they ask?Expect him gone by the end of the year.As for Bush, his every major initiative -- dismantling SocialSecurity, dumbing down science and research into battlingdisease, pushing through radical judges who can't gainreasonable support from moderates in both parties, not tomention "stabilizing" Iraq and Afghanistan -- has been an utterdisaster. Now he's holding press conferences insisting that he isNOT a lame duck, as sure a sign of lame-duckiness as there is.So are Bush and Blair ones for the history books or do they stillhave some fight left in 'em?
