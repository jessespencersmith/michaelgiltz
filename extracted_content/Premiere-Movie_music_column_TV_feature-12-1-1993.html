ELEVISION MAY BE the bastard 
stepchild of the movies-smaller pic­
ture, smaller stories , smaller stars-but 
it provides a unique challenge to com­
posers. For regular series, major themes 
have to be instantly memorable yet not 
grow tiresome week after week. For 
miniseries, musical ideas must stretch to fill six 
hours of airtime-or more. Here are some 
scores that rise to the occasion. 
Wild Palms (Capitol). Like the miniseries it­
self, Ryuichi Sakamoto's flamboyant, synthe­
sizer-driven score sometimes falls flat, but it is 
nevertheless smart-even inspired ("Harry to 
Hospital")-and makes good use of a few 
nifty pop hits ("Can't Take My Eyes off You"). 
Brideshead Revisited (Chrysalis ). Elegant 
and elegiac, this is clear-eyed nostalgia for the 
upper crust. "Orphans of the Storm" and 
"Brideshead Theme" are some of the high­
lights of this beautiful reverie. 
Masada (Varese Sarabande ). Jerry Gold­
smith's majestic, mournful work is the perfect 
match for the tragic heroism of Judean rebels 
who commit mass suicide rather than surren­
der to the Romans. An essential piece. Also 
impressive is Craig Safan's score for Son of the 
Morning Star (Intrada), featuring an excep­
tionally complex final cue, "Lirtle Big Horn." 
Strange interludes: 
Sakamoto's Palms; 
Frontiere's Limits. Inspector Morse 
(Caroline). Barrington 
Pheloung provides low­
key but memorable music 
for the British series fea­
turing the brusque in­
spector, as well as con­
ducting specially recorded 
selections from Mozart, 
Puccini, and others. 
More crime-fighting de­
lights: Henry Mancini's 
Peter Gunn (RCA), 
which redefined hip 
("Dreamsville ," "A Pro­
found Gass"); and Sher­
lock Holmes (Varese), for 
which Patrick Gower's 
marvelous score (show-
casing the violin, natural­
ly) reveals the cerebral sleuth's emotional heart. 
The Outer Limits (GNP Crescendo ). Do­
minic Frontiere 's melodramatic music is the 
centerpiece of this lavish package, which 
includes the series's famous voice intro and a 
sound-effects library. Also check out The Best 
of the Twilight Zone (Varese), which boasts 
such talented names as Herrmann , Steiner, 
and Goldsmith. MICHAEL GILTZ</p>
