THEATER REVIEW: GATZ *** out of ****
Gatz  is both the most faithful and the most playfully
inventive theatrical adaptation of a book I've ever
seen. Running at the Public, this production of the
Elevator Repair Service  company includes every single
word of The Great Gatsby  by F. Scott Fitzgerald.
While this sounds dutiful and slavish, the show is
anything but. ( Go here for tickets .)
It's set in a rundown office (late 80s?) with wirelessphones and clunky old computers that take forever to
boot up. One employee (Scott Shepherd) gets so boredwaiting for his computer to turn on that he starts
reading The Great Gatsby . Then the fun begins. As the man reads, he naturally takes on the role of Nick,
the narrator of most of the novel. Shepherd looks like a younger Damian Lewis and has the same actingclarity. His reading is not rote, exactly, but he's a little shy as office work goes on around him. Sometimeshe reads loudly, sometimes he's sheepish, but he keeps on going as other employees walk in and out of
the room, stare at him quizzically, ask people to sign this or file that and so on. All these actions are
mimed or mumbled so that the only words we hear are Fitzgerald's.

<p>Just when Gatz  might seem a staged reading with a little background noise, another employee (the
excellent Gary Wilmes) bursts out with a line of dialogue that "Nick" soon realizes is the next line in the
book, a line spoken by Tom, the blustery husband of Daisy, who is of course the long-lost love of Gatz
aka Jay Gatsby. A bit startled, Nick keeps reading, adding in "he said" or "he exclaimed" as needed whilethe two of them converse. Suddenly the production blossoms open and during the next six hours (!) the
most exciting tension comes not from the story of Gatsby and his doomed passion for Daisy and the
American Dream but from the way that story is told.
It's almost impossible to keep track of how many levels this show works on. You have one man reading
the text. Then you have coworkers joining in with dialogue of various characters, from Jordan, the pro
athlete and romantic dalliance of Nick, to friends and shady types to Gatsby himself. This shades intofull-on scenes close to a "real" performance with workers and characters merging, like the raucous
afternoon party at a love nest for Tom and his married mistress, in which everyone is drinking and
laughing and papers go flying everywhere. But the very next moment that feeling is undercut by anothercoworker walking into the room and wondering who made all this mess and slowly cleaning it up. At
other times, Nick begins doing the voice of a character only to have a coworker step in and take over the
role halfway through a scene. By the end of the show, some characters in the novel simply show up andseem to have no role in the office whatsoever.
This all sounds very meta. And it is. But it never distracts for a moment from the story in the novel.
Cleverly, it even gooses up the novel at times. For example, a dry passage in which Nick details the many
people who have attended Gatsby's parties is enlivened through onstage antics by Nick's fellow
employees in the office.
Directed with unflagging invention by John Collins, this is unquestionably a unique theatrical event you'd
be sorry to miss. Shepherd holds the stage effortlessly for the entire show, which includes four acts, two
intermissions and a dinner break. He's surrounded by a terrific ensemble. As Gatsby, Jim Fletchercertainly doesn't cut the same figure as Robert Redford. But he slowly gains a gravitas that befits the man
around which so much revolves. I never quite felt that Victoria Vazquez got a handle on Daisy, but Tom
and Gatsby couldn't get a handle on her either, could they? Susie Sokol has a lot of fun as Jordan andvirtually everyone else is sharp and memorable in their supporting turns, right down to the sound design
of Ben Williams, who is on stage throughout and plays various small roles with aplomb. The simple fact
that the sound designer is visible lets us appreciate the subtlety and importance of the work he does,work that plays an unsung role in most shows.
During the dinner break, after three hours of this show in which the ground beneath your feet is always
shifting, I was exhilarated. So why only three stars? The final act was a bit of a letdown emotionally. Thatmay simply reflect the deflating end of the novel, which I always felt puttered to a close after the
melodramatic plot twists that point to the violent end. Or it may simply reflect six hours in the theater,

Second...where the excitement of a new approach to a literary work slowly flags. Shepherd, who is exceptional,
stumbled a few brief moments over the words towards the end. Ross Fletcher, who plays the father of
Gatsby, seemed out of sync with the role and the rest of the cast and his plaintive, sad turn didn't quiteregister. Maybe it's just my own prejudice against a novel that never enthralled me (it's not even myfavorite Fitzgerald work). Despite these momentary lapses, when the show makes one final twist and
Shepherd goes "off book" and simply puts down the novel and delivers the final passages of the work,
Gatz  regains the surprise of the beginning of the show and finds the emotional core in Fitzgerald's aching
farewell.
It would be fascinating to see if other novels could be illuminated and opened up by this approach. Since
it works much more interestingly than a gimmick, I imagine it would. Just please, don't tackle Proust.
OTHER TAKES ON THE SHOW
Ben Brantley of the New York Times  calls it a "work of singular imagination and intelligence" and gives
an unqualified rave.Jeremy Gerard of Bloomsberg  also raved, called it extraordinary and said, "You won't want to miss a
word."Elizabeth Vincentelli of the New York Post  gave it 2 1/2 out of 4 stars and called it an inspired concept,
but added, "it's as maddeningly tedious as it is brilliant."Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News  gave it 2 1/2 stars out of 5 and called it a "fanny-
numbing readathon."
David Finkle of Theatremania  calls it mesmerizing and said, "the lengthy production goes by in what
seems like a blink of an eye."
