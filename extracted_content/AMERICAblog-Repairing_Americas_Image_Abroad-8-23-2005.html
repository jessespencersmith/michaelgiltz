8/23/2005 10:34:00 PMBush's buddy Karen P. Hughes is finally ready to startimproving our country's image overseas. Gee, not a momenttoo soon. Here are a few thoughts for her:***Don't torture prisoners and undermine everything thiscountry stands for -- doing so mocks the values that used torepresent a beacon of hope to people around the world.***When prisoners are tortured, punish the officials in charge;don't give them medals.***Don't launch illegal wars that are unjustified by the facts,by international law and by common sense.***Don't cozy up to cruel monarchies that fund extremism likeSaudi Arabia. Don't cozy up to Pakistan, a military dictatorshipthat is the world's biggest supplier of WMD material andknow-how to rogue states and terrorist groups. When you do,no one will believe you truly support democracy.***Don't encourage military coups in Venezuela and then turnaround and cynically claim that country's democraticallyelected leader is a threat to democracy in South America.Any other suggestions for Karen?
