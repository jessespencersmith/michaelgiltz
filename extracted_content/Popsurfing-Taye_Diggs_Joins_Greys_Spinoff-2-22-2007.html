            <p>Newer PostOlder PostT H U R S D AY,  F E B R U A RY  2 2 ,  2 0 0 7Taye Diggs Joins "Grey's" SpinoffI failed to do my job and ignored the early news of a spin-off from"Grey's Anatomy." I've already grown disenchanted with the show (itwas the Super Bowl episode and the exploding bomb that turned meoff; they were doing crazy stunts like this so early in the show's run thatit set off warning bells) and frankly the idea of a spin-off just bored me.So now Taye Diggs looks set to join the spin-off, in an undeterminedrole, if it actually happens. For fans of the show, it's all bad news:creator Shonda Rhimes will have her attention diverted between"Anatomy" and the spin-off AND a show about female journalists she'salso developing. I'll never understand why people who are luckyenough to create an acclaimed, hit series can be so eager to jump toOTHER shows when it takes every ounce of energy you have to keep agood series working well. I know, I know, money and all that. Butcouldn't they at least wait till season five?POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
