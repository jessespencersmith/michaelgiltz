8/03/2004 02:57:00 AMHere's an attempt at positive spin on the no-bounce DemocraticConvention. Polls are starting to focus in on "likely voters." Everyonedefines this grooup slightly differently. But basically, it includes askingthe person you're polling if they voted in the last election, do theyknow where their local polling station is, etc. It's safe to assume thatNOT having voted in the last election makes you much less likely tobe considered a "likely voter." As pointed out on "Real Time With BillMaher" on HBO, the American public is focused on politics with a realpassion not seen perhaps since Vietnam. There is probably asignificant percentage of Americans who didn't vote in 2000 who arenow bound and determined to do so -- it's a post 9/11 world, they'reangry about Iraq, they saw Michael Moore's movie, or whatever. Ifjust one percent of the population feels driven to vote in 2004 andthey didn't vote in 2000, that's three million votes, enough to turn avictory on either side into an electoral landslide. And there's a goodchance that shift, that passion to vote -- be it "Throw the bum out" or"God bless George Bush" -- won't be reflected in the polls.
