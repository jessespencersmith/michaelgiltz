8/27/2004 01:52:00 PMIn a wide-ranging interview with the New York Times, Bush says thathe doesn't believe Kerry lied about his war record, still refused tocondemn the scurillious ads that made that charge without anyfactual basis or eyewitness evidence, admits he made a"miscalculation" about the post-war conditions of Iraq (is that likeadmitting a mistake?) and so forth. But my favorite bit came whenthe NYT brought up his own administration's new report that finallyacknowledged what the overwhelming scientific evidence has madeclear: that a major factor in global warming is carbon dioxideemissions."On environmental issues, Mr. Bush appeared unfamiliar with anadministration report delivered to Congress on Wednesday thatindicated that emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trappinggases were the only likely explanation for global warming over thelast three decades. Previously, Mr. Bush and other officials hademphasized uncertainties in understanding the causes andconsequences of global warming."The new report was signed by Mr. Bush's secretaries of energy andcommerce and his science adviser. Asked why the administration hadchanged its position on what causes global warming, Mr. Bush replied,'Ah, we did? I don't think so.'"Clueless. Maybe if he glanced at a newspaper every once in a while,Bush would know what his own administration was doing.
