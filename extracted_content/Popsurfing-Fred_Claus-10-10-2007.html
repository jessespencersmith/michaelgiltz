            <p>W E D N E S D AY,  O C TO B E R  1 0 ,  2 0 0 7Fred ClausJoe and I have a thing for bad movie taglines -- the descriptive phraseat the bottom of a movie poster. Classic ones include "Alien" ("In space,no one can hear you scream") and "Jaws II" ("Just when you thought itwas safe to go back in the water,").We were tickled by the abysmal tagline for the Keanu Reeves footballscrubs movie "The Replacements" -- "Pros on strike. Regular guys getto play." Joe insists this wasn't the tagline, just somebody's attempt todescribe the film that somehow got put in as the tagline by mistake. Itcouldn't be more banal and straightforward.Today I saw a doozy of a tagline for "Fred Claus." It was so bad -- andlong -- that I burst out laughing and stopped so I could call Joe andread it to him. The next three people walking by stared at the poster,wondering what I found so funny. It shows Vince Vaughn on a BigWheel, looking dorky with Paul Giamatti dressed as Santa in thebackground, rolling his eyes. The tagline?"Christmas comes every yearBut this holiday seasonSanta's brother is coming along for the ride."Could it be any more tiresome or dull? No. And I thought of a betterone in two seconds:"Santa's brother? Oh, brother!"Maybe I should be in marketing.POSTED BY MICHAEL IN NEW YORK AT
