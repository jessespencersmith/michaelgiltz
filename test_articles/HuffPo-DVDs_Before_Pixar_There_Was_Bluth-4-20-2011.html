(There's a quaint word: "dial.") If you want to know where The Daily Show came from, start right here.</p><p> THE KING'S SPEECH ($39.99 BluRay or $29.98 regular DVD; Anchor Bay) -- This deserved Oscar winner tells the story of George VI, a reluctant king who was always in the shadow of his glamorous brother and beloved if tradition-bound father.</p><p> George (Bertie to his family) also suffers from a terriblestutter, which makes it painful to fulfill his obligations as a member of the Royal Family in the 30s.Thanks to his wife (a spot-on Helena Bonham Cater), Bertie finally finds a speech therapist who can helphim: the eccentric Aussie Lionel (Rush).</p><p> In Lionel's home, under terms of equality and respect, Bertieslowly and with difficulty starts to master his stutter.</p><p> This is pure Masterpiece Theater, with both actorsrelishing the many comic moments in the script (cursing helps one avoid the stutter, it should be said) and the drama in Bertie's situation.</p><p> When his brother abdicates for the woman he loves, Bertie is thrust onto the throne just as England needs a king to rally around for World War II.</p><p> Tom Hooper's film is abroadly appealing, very funny and quite moving.</p><p> RABBIT HOLE E ($29.95; Lionsgate) -- I missed the Broadway run of the acclaimed play Rabbit Hole, which is a shame.</p><p> It's always a shame to miss theater but I would also love to compare Nicole Kidman inthe feature film with Cynthia Nixon in the play.</p><p> Both played grieving mothers mourning the accidentaldeath of their four-year-old son.</p><p> Kidman is married to Aaron Eckhart, who for a change gets to play adecent guy and does it quite convincingly.</p><p> The dominating mood is awkwardness.</p><p> Kidman feels awkwardat group therapy, feels awkward around her mother (played by Dianne Wiest, who keeps comparing thedeath of her son -- a 30-year-old heroin addict that ODed -- to Kidman's little boy running into traffic), feels awkward in the grocery store, around friends, and even in her own home.</p><p> The heart of the film is Kidman's tentative approach to the high school boy that drove the car that killed her son, a boy whoclearly wasn't speeding or drunk -- the child just jumped out into the road and that was it.</p><p> Miles Teller TOP VIDEO PICKS 1 of 10 Lindsay Lohan Back in the Slammer Beckhams In, Obamas Outat Royal Wedding Olsen's Wacky Fur Outfit MOST DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW 1 of 2 HOT ON FACEBOOK 1 of 3 More Celebrity News at People.com More Celebrity News at Popeater.comStefano Langone RevealsHis Relationship Status READ MORE Zach Braff's New Role:Drug Dealer Backstage, Emotional Lady Gaga Cries and Prays Royal Wedding Guest List Revealed: Who's Going? Lindsay Lohan Quickly Released From Jail LeAnn Rimes, Eddie Cibrian Married Viral Star Antoine Dodson ARRESTED Like 5K Gwyneth Paltrow Is Right.</p><p> We're All Jealous. (Of Her and George W.</p><p> Bush.) Like 4K (the teen) and Kidman are good in their scenes.</p><p> But surely the whole film and especially those moments should feel wrenching and dangerous and sad, with an almost unbearable tension.</p><p> The movie is directednicely by John Cameron Mitchell and the performances are solid.</p><p> But for some reason, it doesn't havethat frightening edge to it, where you feel the pain at every moment.</p><p> I don't quite know why that is, butthere you are.</p><p> THE BOB HOPE COLLECTION VOLUME TWO ($34.93; Shout) -- It's not that strange to make a career out of playing a loser or a drunk or a hobo. (I know an actor who keeps getting work playinghomeless people in movies and TV and short films; I've never seen him indoors.) So Bob Hope playing acoward and a weasel is not surprising.</p><p> But as a leading man? But his appeal is easy to spot even in theseminor flicks.</p><p> Once you get beyond the Road movies with Bing Crosby and the flicks in Volume One, thepickings are slim indeed.</p><p> But for hardcore fans, this is gives you a chance to watch movies that don't evenget screened on late night TV anymore.</p><p> GULLIVER'S TRAVELS ($39.99 BluRay or $29.98 regular DVD; FOX) HOT ON TWITTER 1 of 2 HUFFPOST'S BIG NEWS PAGES Gabrielle Giffords Russia Libya Protests Michele Bachmann 2012 Economy Interest Rates Civil Rights Eat The Press Tribeca Film Festival MORE BIG NEWS PAGES » mayhemstudios RT @sbeasla : What happens when you tickle a little penguin? http://j.mp/dEZjCM via @huffingtonpost twsuccess Antoine Dodson Arrested For Marijuana Possession http://huff.to/edLaIo THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER ($39.98 BluRay or $29.98 regular DVD; FOX) -- Two almost-franchises probably end here.</p><p> The Narnia series started off with a bang commercially but audiences soon ray away.</p><p> The fatal mistake was in believing that C.S.</p><p> Lewis had penned an action adventure franchise when nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p> Every attemptto pump up the excitement -- a problem magnified on this film by tackling the book they felt offered themost chances for this -- simply pulled the movies away from the gentle, Christian parable at the heart of the story.</p><p> On Gulliver , it seems like they had the somewhat amusing idea of casting Jack Black as Gulliver... and then thought their work was done.</p><p> MYSTIC PIZZA LARS AND THE REAL GIRL ($19.99 each on BluRay; MGM) -- Let's end with some good news: two winners.</p><p> Mystic Pizza is best remembered of course for turning Julia Roberts into a star.</p><p> She lights up the screen so easily it's no wonder everyone knew Roberts was destined for big things.</p><p> But the movie is acharmer in its own right, with Lili Taylor and Vincent Phillip D'Onofrio as stand outs in a fine cast tellingthe romantic but realistic story of three young women just out of high school and enjoying their last summer of freedom before college or life takes over.</p><p> Lars and the Real Girl is a real gem.</p><p> It's premise is so outrageous -- a lonely guy (Ryan Gosling) suddenly starts "dating" a blow-up doll he got in the mail and treats like a real person -- that you just assume it's raunchy and edgy and envelope-pushing.</p><p> Far fromit.</p><p> This movie feels like a Frank Capra fable where a town comes together to support this sad sack anyway they can.</p><p> Think of it as the modern equivalent of Harvey , the movie where a drunken Jimmy Stewart insisted his best friend was a giant, invisible rabbit.</p><p> Maybe in some alternate universe Harveyand that doll (named Bianca) are a couple.</p><p> Thanks for reading.</p><p> Michael Giltz is the co-host of Showbiz Sandbox , a weekly pop culture podcast that reveals the industry take on entertainment news of the day and features top journalists and opinion makers as guests.</p><p> It's available free on iTunes.</p><p> Visit Michael Giltz at his website and his daily blog.</p><p> Download his podcast of celebrity interviews and his radio show, also called Popsurfing and also available for free on iTunes.</p><p> Link to him on Netflix and gain access to thousands of ratings and reviews .</p><p> NOTE: Michael Giltz is provided with free copies of DVDs to consider for review.</p><p> He typically does notLindsay Lohan Quickly Released From Jail After...
